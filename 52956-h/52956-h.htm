<p class="normal">&quot;Mr. Bloundelle-Burton is one of the most successful of the
purveyors of historical romance who have started up in the wake of Stanley
Weyman and Conan Doyle. He has a keen eye for the picturesque, a happy instinct
for a dramatic (or more generally a melodramatic) situation, and he is apt and
careful in his historic paraphernalia. He usually succeeds, therefore, in
producing an effective story.&quot;--<i>Charleston News and Courier</i>.</p>

<p class="continue"><b>Fortune's my Foe</b>.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;The story moves briskly, and there is plenty of dramatic
action.&quot;--<i>Philadelphia Telegraph</i>.</p>

<p class="continue"><b>The Clash of Arms</b>.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Well written, and the interest is sustained from the
beginning to the end of the tale.&quot;--<i>Brooklyn Eagle</i>.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Vividness of detail and rare descriptive power give the story
life and excitement.&quot;--<i>Boston Herald</i>.</p>

<p class="continue"><b>Denounced</b>.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;A story of the critical times of the vagrant and ambitious
Charles I, it is so replete with incident and realistic happenings that one
seems translated to the very scenes and days of that troublous era in English
history.&quot;--<i>Boston Courier</i>.</p>

<p class="continue"><b>The Scourge of God</b>.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;The story is one of the best in style, construction,
information, and graphic power, that have been written in recent years.&quot;--<i>Dial,
Chicago</i>.</p>

<p class="continue"><b>In the Day of Adversity</b>.</p>
<p class="normal">&quot;Mr. Burton's creative skill is of the kind which must
fascinate those who revel in the narratives of Stevenson, Rider Haggard, and
Stanley Weyman. Even the author of 'A Gentleman of France' has not surpassed the
writer of 'In the Day of Adversity' in the moving interest of his tale.&quot;--<i>St.
James's Gazette</i>.</p>

<h4><a name="div1_01" href="#div1Ref_01">CHAPTER I.</a></h4>

<h5>&quot;YOU WILL FORGIVE?&quot;</h5>
<br>

<p class="normal">A young man, good-looking, with well-cut features, and
possessing a pair of clear blue-grey eyes, sat in a first-class smoking
compartment of a train standing in Waterloo Station--a train that, because there
was one of those weekly race-meetings going on farther down the line, which take
place all through the year, gave no sign of ever setting forth upon its journey.
Perhaps it was natural that it should not do so, since, as the dwellers on the
southern banks of the Thames are well aware, the special trains for the
frequenters of race-courses take precedence of all other travellers; yet,
notwithstanding that such is the case, this young man seemed a good deal annoyed
at the delay. One knows how such annoyance is testified by those subjected to
that which causes it; how the watch is frequently drawn forth and consulted, the
station clock glanced at both angrily and often, the officials interrogated, the
cigarette flung impatiently out of the window, and so forth; wherefore no
further description of the symptoms is needed.</p>

<p class="normal">All things, however, come to an end at last, and this young
man's impatience was finally appeased by the fact of the train in which he sat
moving forward heavily, after another ten minutes' delay; and also by the fact
that, after many delays and stoppages, it eventually passed through Vauxhall and
gradually, at a break-neck speed of about ten miles an hour, forced its way on
towards the country.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Thank goodness!&quot; exclaimed Julian Ritherdon, &quot;thank goodness!
At last there is a chance that I may see the dear old governor before night
falls. Yet, what on earth is it that I am to be told when I do see him--what on
earth does his mysterious letter mean?&quot; And, as he had done half a dozen times
since the waiter had brought the &quot;mysterious letter&quot; to the room in the huge
caravansary where he had slept overnight, he put his hand in the breast pocket
of his coat and, drawing it forth, began another perusal of the document.</p>

<p class="normal">Yet his face clouded--as it had done each time he read the
letter, as it was bound to cloud on doing so!--at the first worst words it
contained; words which told the reader how soon--very soon now, unless the
writer was mistaken--he would no longer form one of the living human units of
existence.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Poor old governor, poor old dad!&quot; Lieutenant Ritherdon
muttered as he read those opening lines. &quot;Poor old dad! The best father any man
ever had--the very best. And now to be doomed; now--and he scarcely fifty! It is
rough. By Jove, it is!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Then again he read the letter, while by this time the train,
by marvellous exertions, was making its way swiftly through all the beauty that
the springtide had brought to the country lying beyond the suburban belt. Yet,
just now, he saw nothing of that beauty, and failed indeed to appreciate the
warmth of the May day, or to observe the fresh young green of the leaves or the
brighter green of the growing corn--he saw and enjoyed nothing of all this. How
should he do so, when the letter from his father appeared like a knell of doom
that was being swiftly tolled with, for conclusion, hints--nay! not hints, but
statements--that some strange secrets which had long lain hidden in the past
must now be instantly revealed, or remain still hidden--forever?</p>

<p class="normal">It was not a long letter; yet it told enough, was pregnant
with matter.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;If,&quot; the writer said, after the usual form of address, &quot;your
ship, the Caractacus, does not get back with the rest of the Squadron ere long,
I am very much afraid we have seen the last of each other; that--and Heaven
alone knows how hard it is to have to write such words!--we shall never meet
again in this world. And this, Julian, would make my death more terrible than I
can bear to contemplate. My boy, I pray nightly, hourly, that you may soon come
home. I saw the specialist again yesterday and he said----Well! no matter what
he said. Only, only--time is precious now; there is very little more of it in
this world for me.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Julian Ritherdon gazed out of the open window as he came to
these words, still seeing nothing that his eyes rested on, observing neither
swift flowering pink nor white may, nor budding chestnut, nor laburnum bursting
into bloom, nor hearing the larks singing high up above the cornfields--thinking
only again and again: &quot;It is hard. Hard! Hard! To die now--and he not fifty!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And I have so much to tell you,&quot; he read on, &quot;so much to--let
me say it at once--confess. Oh! Julian, in my earlier days I committed a
monstrous iniquity--a sin that, if it were not for our love for each
other--thank God, there has always been that between us!--nothing can deprive
the past of that!--would make my ending even worse than it must be. Now it must
be told to you. It must. Already, because I begin to fear that your ship may be
detained, I have commenced to write down the error, the crime of my
life--yet--yet--I would sooner tell it to you face to face, with you sitting
before me. Because I do not think, I cannot think that, when you recall how I
have always loved you, done my best for you, you will judge me hardly, nor----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">The perusal of this letter came, perforce, to an end now, for
the train, after running through a plantation of fir and pine trees, had pulled
up at a little wayside station; a little stopping-place built to accommodate the
various dwellers in the villa residences scattered all around it, as well as
upon the slope of the hill that rose a few hundred yards off from it.</p>

<p class="normal">Here Julian Ritherdon was among home surroundings, since, even
before the days when he had gone as a cadet into the Britannia and long before
he had become a lieutenant in the Royal Navy, his father had owned one of those
villas. Now, therefore, the station-master and the one porter (who slept
peacefully through the greater part of the day, since but few trains stopped
here) came forward to greet him and to answer his first question as to how his
father was.</p>

<p class="normal">Nor, happily, were their answers calculated to add anything
further to his anxiety, since the station-master had not &quot;heerd&quot; that Mr.
Ritherdon was any &quot;wus&quot; than usual, and the porter had &quot;seed&quot; him in his garden
yesterday. Only, the latter added gruesomely, &quot;he was that white that he looked
like--well, he dursn't say what he looked like.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Mr. Ritherdon kept no vehicle or trap of any sort, and no cab
was ever to be seen at this station unless ordered by an intending arrival or
departing traveller on the previous day, from the village a mile or so off;
wherefore Julian started at once to walk up to the house, bidding the porter
follow him with his portmanteau. And since the villa, which stood on the little
pine-wooded eminence, was no more than a quarter of a mile away, it was not long
ere he was at the garden gate and, a moment later, at the front door. Yet, from
the time he had left the precincts of the station and had commenced the ascent
of the hill, he had seen the white face of his father at the open window and the
white hand frequently waved to him.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Poor old governor,&quot; he thought to himself, &quot;he has been
watching for the coming of the train long before it had passed Wimbleton, I'll
be sworn.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Then, in another moment, he was with his father and, their
greeting over, was observing the look upon his face, which told as plainly as
though written words had been stamped upon it of the doom that was about to
fall.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What is it?&quot; he said a little later, almost in an awestruck
manner. Awestruck because, when we stand in the presence of those whose sentence
we know to be pronounced beyond appeal there falls upon us a solemnity almost as
great as that which we experience when we gaze upon the dead. &quot;What is it,
father?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;The heart,&quot; Mr. Ritherdon answered. &quot;Valvular disease. Sir
Josias Smith says. However, do not let us talk about it. There is so much else
to be discussed. Tell me of the cruise in the Squadron, where you went to, what
you saw----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;But--your letter! Your hopes that I should soon be back. You
have not forgotten? The--the--something--you have to tell me.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No,&quot; Mr. Ritherdon answered. &quot;I have not forgotten. Heaven
help me! it has to be told. Yet--yet not now. Let us enjoy the first few hours
together pleasantly. Do not ask to hear it now.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">And Julian, looking at him, saw those signs which, when
another's heart is no longer in its normal state, most of us have observed: the
lips whitening for a moment, the left hand raised as though about to be pressed
to the side, the dead white of the complexion.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;If,&quot; he said, &quot;it pains you to tell me anything of the past,
why--why--tell it at all? Is it worth while? Your life can contain little that
must necessarily be revealed and--even though it should do so--why reveal it?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I must,&quot; his father answered, &quot;I must tell you. Oh!&quot; he
exclaimed, &quot;oh! if at the last it should turn you against me--make
you--despise--hate--&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No! No! never think that,&quot; Julian replied quickly, &quot;never
think that. What! Turn against you! A difference between you and me! It is
impossible.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">As he spoke he was standing by his father's side, the latter
being seated in his armchair, and Julian's hand was on the elder man's shoulder.
Then, as he patted that shoulder--once, too, as he touched softly the almost
prematurely grey hair--he said, his voice deep and low and full of emotion:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Whatever you may tell me can make no difference in my love
and respect for you. How can you think so? Recall what we have been to each
other since I was a child. Always together till I went to sea--not father and
son, but something almost closer, comrades----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Ah, Julian!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Do you think I can ever forget that, or forget your
sacrifices for me; all that you have done to fit me for the one career I could
have been happy in? Why, if you told me that you--oh! I don't know what to say!
how to make you understand me!--but, if you told me you were a murderer, a
convict, a forger, I should still love you; love you as you say you loved the
mother I never knew----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Don't! Don't! For Heaven's sake don't speak like that--don't
speak of her! Your mother! I--I--have to speak to you of her later. But
now--now--I cannot bear it!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">For a moment Julian looked at his father, his eyes full of
amazement; around his heart a pang that seemed to grip at it. They had not often
spoken of his mother in the past, the subject always seeming one that was too
painful to Mr. Ritherdon to be discussed, and, beyond the knowledge that she had
died in giving birth to him, Julian knew nothing further. Yet now, his father's
agitation--such as he had never seen before--his strange excitement, appalled,
almost staggered him.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Why?&quot; he exclaimed, unable to refrain from dwelling upon her.
&quot;Why not speak of her? Was she----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;She was an angel. Ah,&quot; he continued, &quot;I was right--this story
of my past must be told--of my crime. Remember that, Julian, remember that. My
crime! If you listen to me, if you will hear me, as you must--then remember it
is the story of a crime that you will learn. And,&quot; he wailed almost, &quot;there is
no help for it. You must be told!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Tell it, then,&quot; Julian said, still speaking very gently,
though even as he did so it seemed as if he were the elder man, as if he were
the father and the other the son. &quot;Tell it, let us have done with vagueness.
There has never been anything hidden between us till now. Let there be nothing
whatever henceforth.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And you will not hate me? You will--forgive, whatever I may
have to tell?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What have I said?&quot; Julian replied. And even as he did so, he
again smoothed his father's hair while he stood beside him.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="div1_02" href="#div1Ref_02">CHAPTER II.</a></h4>

<h5>THE STORY OF A CRIME</h5>
<br>

<p class="normal">The disclosure was made, not among, perhaps,
surroundings befitting the story that was told; not with darkness outside and in
the house--with, in truth, no lurid environments whatever. Instead, the elderly
man and the young one, the father and son, sat facing each other in the bright
sunny room into which there streamed all the warmth and brilliancy of the late
springtide, and into which, now and again, a humble-bee came droning or a
butterfly fluttered. Also, between them was a table white with napery, sparkling
with glass and silver, gay with fresh-cut flowers from the garden. It is amid
such surroundings that, nowadays, we often enough listen to stories brimful with
fate--stories baneful either to ourselves or others--hear of trouble that has
fallen like a blight upon those we love, or learn that something has happened
which is to change forever the whole current of our own lives.</p>

<p class="normal">It was thus that Julian Ritherdon listened to the narrative
his father now commenced to unfold; thus amid such environment, and with a
freshly-lit cigarette between his lips.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You do not object to this?&quot; he asked, pointing to the latter;
&quot;it will not disturb you?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I object to nothing that you do,&quot; Mr. Ritherdon replied. &quot;In
my day, I have, as you know, been a considerable smoker myself.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, in the days, your days, that I know of. But--forgive me
for asking--only--is it to tell me of your earlier years, those with which I am
not acquainted, that you summoned me here and bade me lose no time in coming to
you?--those earlier days of which you have spoken so little in the past?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;For that,&quot; replied the other slowly, &quot;and other reasons. To
hear things that will startle and disconcert you. Yet--yet--they have their
bright side. You are the heir to a great----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;My dear father!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Your 'dear father'! Ay! Your 'dear father'!&quot; Once more, nay,
twice more, he repeated those words--while all the time the younger man was
looking at him intently. &quot;Your 'dear father.'&quot; Then, suddenly, he exclaimed:
&quot;Come, let us make a beginning. Are you prepared to hear a strange story?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I am prepared to hear anything you may have to tell me.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;So be it. Pay attention. You have but this moment called me
your 'dear father.' Well, I am not your father! Though I should have been had
all happened as I once--so long ago--so--so long ago--hoped would be the case.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;<i>Not--my--father!</i>&quot; and the younger man stared with a
startled look at the other. &quot;Not--my--father. You, who have loved me, fostered
me, anticipated every thought, every wish of mine since the first moment I can
recollect--not my father! Oh!&quot; and even as he spoke he laid his hand, brown but
shapely, on the white, sickly looking one of the other. &quot;Don't say that! Don't
say that!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I must say it.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;My God! who, then, are you? What are you to me?
And--and--who--am--<i>I</i>? It cannot be that we are of strange blood.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">And the faltering words of the younger man, the blanched look
that had come upon his face beneath his bronze--also the slight tremor of the
cigarette between his fingers would have told Mr. Ritherdon, even though he had
not already known well enough that such was the case, how deep a shock his words
had produced.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No,&quot; he answered slowly, and on his face, too, there was, if
possible, a denser, more deadly white than had been there an hour ago--while his
lips had become even a deeper leaden hue than before. &quot;No. Heaven at least be
praised for that! I am your father's brother, therefore, your uncle.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Thank Heaven we are so near of kin,&quot; and again the hand of
the young man pressed that of the elder one. &quot;Now,&quot; he continued, though his
voice was solemn--hoarse as he spoke, &quot;go on. Tell me all. Blow as this
is--yet--tell me all.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;First,&quot; replied the other, &quot;first let me show you something.
It came to me by accident, otherwise perhaps I should not have summoned you so
hurriedly to this meeting; should have restrained my impatience to see you.
Yet--yet--in my state of health, it is best to tell you by word of mouth--better
than to let you find out when--I--am--dead, through the account I have written
and should have left behind me. But, to begin with, read this,&quot; and he took from
his breast pocket a neatly bound notebook, and, opening it, removed from between
the pages a piece of paper--a cutting from a newspaper.</p>

<p class="normal">Still agitated--as he would be for hours, for days hence!--at
all that he had already listened to, still sorrowful at hearing that the man
whom he loved so much, who had been so devoted to him from his infancy, was not
his father, Julian Ritherdon took the scrap and read it. Read it hastily, while
in his ear he heard the other man saying--murmuring: &quot;It is from a paper I buy
sometimes in London at a foreign newspaper shop, because in it there is often
news of a--of Honduras, where, you know, some of my earlier life was passed.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Nodding his head gravely to signify that he heard and
understood, Julian devoured the cutting, which was from the well-known New
Orleans paper, the Picayune. It was short enough to be devoured at a glance. It
ran:</p>
<br>

<p class="normal">Our correspondent at Belize informs us by the last mail, amongst other pieces of
intelligence from the colony, that Mr. Ritherdon (of Desolada), one of the
richest, if not the richest, exporters of logwood and mahogany, is seriously ill
and not expected to recover. Mr. Ritherdon came to the colony nearly thirty
years ago, and from almost the first became extremely prosperous.</p>
<br>

<p class="normal">&quot;Well!&quot; exclaimed Julian, laying down the slip. &quot;Well! It means, I
suppose--that----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He is your father? Yes. That is what it does mean. He is your
father, and the wealth of which that writer speaks is yours if he is now dead;
will be yours, if he is still alive--when he dies.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Because, when our emotion, when any sudden emotion, is too
great for us, we generally have recourse to silence, so now Julian said nothing;
he sitting there musing, astonished at what he had just heard. Then, suddenly,
knowing, reflecting that he must hear more, hear all, that he must be made
acquainted now with everything that had occurred in the far-off past, he said,
very gently: &quot;Yes? Well, father--for it is you whom I shall always regard in
that light--tell me everything. You said just now we had better make a
beginning. Let us do so.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">For a moment Mr. Ritherdon hesitated, it seeming as if he
still dreaded to make his avowal, to commence to unfold the strange
circumstances which had caused him to pass his life under the guise of father to
the young man who was, in truth, his nephew. Then, suddenly, nerving himself, as
it seemed to Julian, he began:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;My brother and I went to British Honduras, twenty-eight years
ago, three years before you were born; at a time when money was to be made there
by those who had capital. And <i>he</i> had some--a few thousand pounds, which
he had inherited from an aunt who died between his birth and mine. I had
nothing. Therefore I went as his companion--his assistant, if you like to call
it so. Yet--for I must do him justice--I was actually his partner. He shared
everything with me until I left him.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes,&quot; the other said. &quot;Yes. Until you left him! Yet, in such
circumstances, why----?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Leave him, you would say. Why? Can you not guess? Not
understand? What separates men from each other more than all else, what divides
brother from brother, what----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;A woman's love, perhaps?&quot; Julian said softly. &quot;Was that it?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes. A woman's love,&quot; Mr. Ritherdon exclaimed, and now his
voice was louder than before, almost, indeed, harsh. &quot;A woman's love. The love
of a woman who loved me in return. That was his fault--that for which, Heaven
forgive me!--I punished him, made him suffer. She was my love--she loved
me--that was certain, beyond all doubt!--and--she married him.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Go on,&quot; Julian said--and now his voice was low, though clear,
&quot;go on.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Her name was Isobel Leigh, and she was the daughter of an
English settler who had fallen on evil days, who had gone out from England with
her mother and with her--a baby. But now he had become a man who was ruined if
he could not pay certain obligations by a given time. They said, in whispers,
quietly, that he had used other people's names to make those obligations
valuable. And--and--I was away in New Orleans on business. You can understand
what happened!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, I can understand. A cruel ruse was practised upon you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;So cruel that, while I was away in the United States,
thinking always about her by day and night, I learnt that she had become his
wife. Then I swore that it should be ruse against ruse. That is the word! He had
made me suffer, he had broken, cursed my life. Well, henceforth, I would break,
curse him! This is how I did it.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Mr. Ritherdon paused a moment--his face white and drawn
perhaps from the emotion caused by his recollection, perhaps from the disease
that was hurrying him to his end. Then, a moment later, he continued:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;There were those with whom I could communicate in Honduras,
those who would keep me well informed of all that was taking place in the
locality: people I could rely upon. And from them there came to New Orleans,
where I still remained, partly on business and partly because it was more than I
could endure to go back and see her his wife, the news that she was about to
become a mother. That maddened me, drove me to desperation, forced me to commit
the crime that I now conceived, and dwelt upon during every hour of the day.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I begin to understand,&quot; Julian said, as Mr. Ritherdon paused.
&quot;I begin to understand.&quot; Then, from that time he interrupted the other no
more--instead, both the narrative and his own feelings held him breathless. The
narrative of how he, a newborn infant, the heir to a considerable property, had
been spirited away from Honduras to England.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I found my way to the neighbourhood of Desolada, stopping at
Belize when once I was back in the colony, and then going on foot by night
through the forest towards where my brother's house was--since I was forced to
avoid the public road--forests that none but those who knew their way could have
threaded in the dense blackness of the tropical night. Yet I almost faltered,
once I turned back, meaning to return to the United States and abandon my plan.
For I had met an Indian, a half-caste, who told me that she, my loved, my lost
Isobel was dying, that--that--she could not survive. And then--then--I made a
compact with myself. I swore that it she lived I would not tear her child away
from her, but that, if--if she died, then he who had made me wifeless should
himself be not only wifeless but childless too. He had tricked me; now he should
be tricked by me. Only--if she should live--I could not break her heart as well.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;But again I returned upon my road: I reached a copse outside
Desolada, outside the house itself. I was near enough to see that the windows
were ablaze with lights, sometimes even I saw people passing behind the blinds
of those windows--once I saw my brother's figure and that excited me again to
madness. If she were dead I swore that then, too, he should become childless.
Her child should become mine, not his. I would have that satisfaction at least.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Still I drew nearer to the house, so near that I could hear
people calling to each other. Once I thought--for now I was quite close--that I
could hear the wailing of the negro women-servants--I saw a half-breed dash past
me on a mustang, riding as for dear life, and I knew, I divined as surely as if
I had been told, that he was gone for the doctor, that she was dying--or was
dead. Your father's chance was past.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Heaven help him!&quot; said Julian Ritherdon. &quot;Heaven help him. It
was an awful revenge, taken at an awful moment. Well! You succeeded?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, I succeeded. She <i>was</i> dead--I saw that when, an
hour later, I crept into the room, and when I took you from out of the arms of
the sleeping negro nurse--when, God forgive me, <i>I stole you!</i>&quot;</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="div1_03" href="#div1Ref_03">CHAPTER III.</a></h4>

<h5>&quot;THE LAND OF THE GOLDEN SUN.&quot;</h5>
<br>

<p class="normal">The mustang halted on a little knoll up
which the patient beast had been toiling for some quarter of an hour, because
upon that knoll there grew a clump of <i>gros-gros</i> and moriche palms which
threw a grateful shade over the white, glaring, and dusty track, and Julian
Ritherdon, dropping the reins on its drenched and sweltering neck, drew out his
cigar-case and struck a light. Also, the negro &quot;boy&quot;--a man thirty years
old--who had been toiling along by its side, flung himself down, crushing
crimson poinsettias and purple dracæna beneath his body, and grunted with
satisfaction at the pause.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;So, Snowball,&quot; Julian said to this descendant of African
kings, &quot;this ends your journey, eh? I am in the right road now and we have got
to say 'Good-bye.' I suppose you don't happen to be thirsty, do you, Pompey?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Hoop! Hoop!&quot; grunted the negro, showing a set of ivories that
a London belle would have been proud to possess, &quot;always thirsty. Always hungry.
Always want tobaccy. Money, too.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Do you!&quot; exclaimed Julian. &quot;By Jove! you'd make a living as a
London johnny. That's what they always want. Pity you don't live in London,
Hannibal. Well, let's see.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Whereon he threw his leg over the great saddle, reached the
ground, and began opening a haversack, from which he took a bottle, a packet,
and a horn cup.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Luncheon time,&quot; he said. &quot;Sun's over the foremast! Come on,
Julius Cæsar, we'll begin.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">After which he opened the packet, in which was a considerable
quantity of rather thickly cut sandwiches, divided it equally, and then filled
the horn cup with the liquid from the bottle, which, after draining, he refilled
and handed to his companion.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I'm sorry it isn't iced, my lily-white friend,&quot; he said; &quot;it
does seem rather warm from continual contact with the mustang's back, but I
daresay you can manage it. Eh?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Manage anything,&quot; the negro replied firmly, his mouth full of
sandwich, &quot;anything. Always----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, I know. 'Thirsty, hungry, want tobacco and money.' I
tell you, old chap, you're lost in this place. London's the spot for you. You're
fitted for a more advanced state of civilization than this.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Hoop. Hoop,&quot; again grunted the negro, and again giving the
huge smile--&quot;want----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;This is getting monotonous, Sambo,&quot; Julian exclaimed. &quot;Come,
let's settle up;&quot; whereon he again replenished the guide's cup, and then drew
forth from his pocket two American dollars, which are by now the standard coin
of the colony. &quot;One dollar was the sum arranged for,&quot; Julian said, &quot;but because
you are a merry soul, and also because a dollar extra isn't ruinous, you shall
have two. And in years to come, my daisy, you can bless the name of Mr.
Ritherdon as that of a man both just and generous. Remember those words, 'just
and generous.'&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">The negro of many sobriquets--at each of which he had laughed
like a child, as in absolute fact the negro is when not (which is extremely
rare!) a vicious brute--seemed, however, to be struck more forcibly by some
other words than those approving ones suggested by Julian as suitable for
recollection, and, after shaking his woolly head a good deal, muttered:
&quot;Ritherdon, Ritherdon,&quot; adding afterwards, &quot;Desolada.&quot; Then he continued: &quot;Hard
man, Massa Ritherdon. Hard man, Massa Ritherdon. Hard man. Cruel man. Beat
Blacky. Beat Whity, too, sometimes. Hard man. Cruel man.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Sambo,&quot; said Julian, feeling (even as he spoke still
jocularly to the creature--a pleasant way being the only one in which to
converse with the African) that he would sooner not have heard these remarks in
connection with his father, &quot;Sambo, you should not say these things to people
about their relatives. <i>That</i> would not do for London;&quot; while at the same
time he reflected that it would be little use telling his guide of the old Latin
proverb suggesting that one should say nothing but good of the dead.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You relative of Massa Ritherdon!&quot; the other grunted now,
though still with the unfailing display of ivories. &quot;You relative. Oh! I know
not that. Now,&quot; he said, thinking perhaps it was time he departed, and before
existing amicable arrangements should be disturbed, &quot;now, I go. Back to Belize.
Good afternoon to you, sir. Good-bye. I hope you like Desolada. Fifteen miles
further on;&quot; and making a kind of shambling bow, he departed back upon the road
they had come. Yet not without turning at every other three or four steps he
took, and waving his hand gracefully as well as cordially to his late employer.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;A simple creature is the honest black!&quot; especially when no
longer a dweller in his original equatorial savagery.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Like it,&quot; murmured Julian to himself, &quot;Yes, I hope so. Since
it is undoubtedly my chief inheritance, I hope I shall!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He had left Belize that morning, by following a route which
the negro knew of, had arrived in the neighbourhood of a place called Commerce
Bight--a spot given up to the cultivation of the cocoanut-tree. And having
proceeded thus far, he knew that by nightfall he would be at Desolada--the
dreary <i>hacienda</i> from which, twenty-six years before, his uncle had
ruthlessly kidnapped him from his father--the father who, he had learnt since he
arrived in the colony, had been dead three months. Also he knew that this
property called Desolada lay some dozen miles or so beyond a village named All
Pines, and on the other side of a river termed the Sittee, and, as he still sat
beneath the palm-trees on the knoll where they had halted for the midday meal,
he wondered what he would find when he arrived there.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is strange,&quot; he mused to himself now, as from out of that
cool, refreshing shade he gazed across groves upon groves of mangroves at his
feet, to where, sparkling in the brilliant cobalt-coloured Caribbean Sea,
countless little reefs and islets--as well as one large reef--dotted the surface
of the ocean, &quot;strange that, at Belize, I could gather no information of my late
father. No! not even when I told the man who kept the inn that I was come on a
visit to Desolada. Why, I wonder, why was it so? My appearance seemed to freeze
them into silence, almost to startle them. Why? Why--this reticence on their
part? Can it be that he was so hated all about here that none will mention him?
Is that it? Remembering what the negro said of him, of his brutality to black
and white, can that be it? Yet my uncle hinted at nothing of the kind.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Still thinking of this, still musing on what lay before him,
he adjusted the saddle (which he had previously loosened to ease the mustang)
once more upon the animal's back. Then, as his foot was in the stirrup there
came, swift as a flash of lightning, an idea into his mind.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I must be like him,&quot; he almost whispered to himself, &quot;so like
him, must bear such a resemblance to him, that they are thunderstruck. And, if
any who saw me can recollect that, twenty-six years ago, his newborn child was
stolen from him on the night his wife died, it is no wonder that they were
thunderstruck. That is, if I do resemble him so much.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">But here his meditations ceased, he understanding that his
name, which he had inscribed in the visitor's book lying on the marble table of
the hotel, would be sufficient to cause all who learnt it to refrain from
speaking about the recently dead man--his namesake.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yet all the same,&quot; he muttered to himself, as now the mule
bore him along a more or less good road which traversed copses of oleanders and
henna plants, allamandas and Cuban Royal palms--the latter of which formed
occasionally a grateful shade from the glare of the sun--&quot;all the same, I wish
that darkey had not spoken about my father's cruelty. I should have preferred
never to learn that he bore such a character. He must have been very different
from my uncle, who, in spite of the one error of his life, was the gentlest soul
that ever lived.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">All the way out from England to New Orleans, and thence to
Belize by a different steamer, his thoughts had been with that dear uncle--who
survived the disclosure he had made but eight days--he being found dead in his
bed on the morning of the ninth day--and those thoughts were with him now.
Gentle memories, too, and kindly, with in them never a strain of reproach for
what had been done by him in his hour of madness and desire for revenge; and
with no other current of ideas running through his reflections but one of pity
and regret for the unhappiness his real father must have experienced at finding
himself bereft at once of both wife and child. Regret and sorrow, too, for the
years which that father must have spent in mourning for him, perhaps in praying
that, as month followed month, his son might in some way be restored to him. And
now he--that son--was in the colony; here, in the very locality where the
bereaved man must have passed so many sad and melancholy years! Here, but too
late!</p>

<p class="normal">Ere he died, George Ritherdon had bidden his nephew make his
way to British Honduras and proclaim himself as what he was; also he had
provided him with that very written statement which he had spoken of as being in
preparation for Julian's own information in case he should die suddenly, ere the
latter returned home.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;With that in your possession,&quot; he had said, two days before
his death actually occurred, &quot;what's there that can stand in the way of your
being acknowledged as his son? He cannot have forgotten my handwriting; and even
if he has, the proofs of what I say are contained in the intimate knowledge that
I testify in this paper of all our surroundings and habits out there. That paper
is a certificate of who you are.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Suppose he is dead when I get there, or that he should have
married again. What then?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He may be dead, but he has not married again. Remember what I
told you last night. I know my brother has remained a widower.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I wonder the paper did not also say that his son was stolen
from him many years ago, or that there was no heir to his property, or something
to that effect.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is strange perhaps that such a state of things is not
mentioned. Yet, the Picayune's correspondent may have forgotten it, or not known
it, or not have thought it worth mention--or have had other news which required
to be published. Half a hundred things might have occurred to prevent mention of
that one.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And,&quot; said Julian, &quot;presuming I do go out to British Honduras
if I can get leave from the Admiralty, on 'urgent private affairs'----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You <i>must</i> go out. It is a fortune for you. Your father
cannot be worth less than forty thousand pounds. You <i>must</i> go out, even
though you have to leave the navy to do so.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Julian vowed inwardly that in no circumstances should the
latter happen, while, at the same time, he thought it by no means unlikely that
the necessary leave would be granted. He had already fifty days' leave standing
to his credit, and he knew that not only his captain, but all his superiors in
the service, thought well of him. The &quot;urgent private affairs,&quot; when properly
explained to their lordships, would make that matter easy.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;When I go to British Honduras, then,&quot; said Julian, putting
now the question which he had been about to ask in a slightly different form,
but asking it nevertheless, &quot;what am I to do supposing he is dead? I may have
many obstacles to encounter--to overcome.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;There can be none--few at least, and none that will be
insurmountable. I had you baptised at New Orleans as his son, and, with my
papers, you will find the certificate of that baptism, while the papers
themselves will explain all. Meanwhile, make your preparations for setting out.
You need not wait for my death----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Don't talk of that!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I must talk of it. At best it cannot be far off. Let us face
the inevitable. Be ready to go as soon as possible. If I am alive when you set
out, I will give you the necessary documents; if I die before you start, they
are here,&quot; and as he spoke he touched lightly the desk at which he always wrote.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="div1_04" href="#div1Ref_04">CHAPTER IV.</a></h4>

<h5>AN ENCOUNTER</h5>
<br>

<p class="normal">And now Julian Ritherdon was here, in
British Honduras, within ten or fifteen miles of the estate known as Desolada--a
name which had been given to the place by some original Spanish settlers years
before his father and uncle had ever gone out to the colony. He was here, and
that father and uncle were dead; here, and on the way to what was undoubtedly
his own property; a property to which no one could dispute his right, since
George Ritherdon, his uncle, had been the only other heir his father had ever
had.</p>

<p class="normal">Yet, even as the animal which bore him continued to pace along
amid all the rich tropical vegetation around them; even, too, as the
yellow-headed parrots and the curassows chattered above his head and the monkeys
leapt from branch to branch, he mused as to whether he was doing a wise thing in
progressing towards Desolada--the place where he was born, as he reflected with
a strange feeling of incredulity in his mind.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;For suppose,&quot; he thought to himself, &quot;that when I get to it I
find it shut up or in the occupation of some other settler--what am I to do
then? How explain my appearance on the scene? I cannot very well ride up to the
house on this animal and summon the garrison to surrender, like some
knight-errant of old, and I can't stand parleying on the steps explaining who I
am. I believe I have gone the wrong way to work after all! I ought to have gone
and seen the Governor or the Chief Justice, or taken some advice, after stating
who I was. Or Mr. Spranger! Confound it, why did I not present that letter of
introduction to him before starting off here?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">The latter gentleman was a well-known planter and merchant
living on the south side of Belize, to whom Julian had been furnished with a
letter of introduction by a retired post-captain whom he had run against in
London prior to his departure, and with whom he had dined at a Service Club. And
this officer had given him so flattering an account of Mr. Spranger's
hospitality, as well as the prominent position which that personage held in the
little capital, that he now regretted considerably that he had not availed
himself of the chance which had come in his way. More especially he regretted
it, too, when there happened to come into his recollection the fact that the
gallant sailor had stated with much enthusiasm--after dinner--that Beatrix
Spranger, the planter's daughter, was without doubt the prettiest as well as the
nicest girl in the whole colony.</p>

<p class="normal">However, he comforted himself with the reflection that the
journey which he was now taking might easily serve as one of inspection simply,
and that, as there was no particular hurry, he could return to Belize and then,
before making any absolute claim upon his father's estate, take the advice of
the most important people in the town.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;All of which,&quot; he said to himself, &quot;I ought to have thought
of before and decided upon. However, it doesn't matter! A week hence will do
just as well as now, and, meanwhile, I shall have had a look at the place which
must undoubtedly belong to me.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">As he arrived at this conclusion, the mustang emerged from the
forest-like copse they had been passing through, and ahead of him he saw, upon
the flat plain, a little settlement or village.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Which,&quot; thought Julian, &quot;must be All Pines. Especially as
over there are the queer-shaped mountains called the 'Cockscomb,' of which the
negro told me.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Then he began to consider the advisability of finding
accommodation at this place for a day or so while he made that inspection of the
estate and residence of Desolada which he had on his ride decided upon.</p>

<p class="normal">All Pines, to which he now drew very near, presented but a
bare and straggling appearance, and that not a particularly flourishing one
either. A factory fallen quite into disuse was passed by Julian as he approached
the village; while although his eyes were able to see that, on its outskirts,
there was more than one large sugar estate, the place itself was a poor one. Yet
there was here that which the traveller finds everywhere, no matter to what part
of the world he directs his footsteps and no matter how small the place he
arrives at may be--an inn. An inn, outside which there were standing four or
five saddled mules and mustangs, and one fairly good-looking horse in excellent
condition. A horse, however, that a person used to such animals might consider
as showing rather more of the hinder white of its eye than was desirable, and
which twitched its small, delicate ears in a manner equally suspicious.</p>

<p class="normal">There seemed very little sign of life about this inn in spite
of these animals, however, as Julian made his way into it, after tying up his
own mustang to a nail in a tree--since a dog asleep outside in the sun and a
negro asleep inside in what might be, and probably was, termed the entrance
hall, scarcely furnished such signs. All the same, he heard voices, and pretty
loud ones too, in some room close at hand, as well as something else, also--a
sound which seemed familiar enough to his ears; a sound that he--who had been
all over the world more than once as a sailor--had heard in diverse places. In
Port Said to wit, in Shanghai, San Francisco, Lisbon, and Monte Carlo. The hum
of a wheel, the click and rattle of a ball against brass, and then a soft
voice--surely it was a woman's!--murmuring a number, a colour, a chance!</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;So, so!&quot; said Julian to himself, &quot;Madame la Roulette, and
here, too. Ah! well, madame is everywhere; why shouldn't she favour this place
as well as all others that she can force her way into?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Then he pushed open a swing door to his right, a door covered
with cocoanut matting nailed on to it, perhaps to keep the place cool, perhaps
to deaden sound--the sound of Madame la Roulette's clicking jaws--though surely
this was scarcely necessary in such an out-of-the-way spot, and entered the room
whence the noise proceeded.</p>

<p class="normal">The place was darkened by matting and Persians; again,
perhaps, to exclude the heat or deaden <i>sound</i>; and was, indeed, so dark
that, until his eyes became accustomed to the dull gloom of the room--vast and
sparsely furnished--he could scarcely discern what was in it. He was, however,
able to perceive the forms of four or five men seated round a table, to see
coins glittering on it; and a girl at the head of the table (so dark that,
doubtless, she was of usual mixed Spanish and Indian blood common to the colony)
who was acting as croupier--a girl in whose hair was an oleander flower that
gleamed like a star in the general duskiness of her surroundings. While, as he
gazed, she twirled the wheel, murmuring softly: &quot;Plank it down before it is too
late,&quot; as well as, &quot;Make your game,&quot; and spun the ball; while, a moment later,
she flung out pieces of gold and silver to right and left of her and raked in
similar pieces, also from right and left of her.</p>

<p class="normal">But the sordid, dusty room, across which the motes glanced in
the single ray of sunshine that stole in and streamed across the table, was
not--it need scarcely be said--a prototype of the gilded palace that smiles over
the blue waters of the Mediterranean, nor of the great gambling chambers in the
ancient streets behind the Cathedral in Lisbon, nor of the white and airy
saloons of San Francisco--instead, it was mean, dusty, and dirty, while over it
there was the f&#339;tid, sickly, tropical atmosphere that pervades places to
which neither light nor constant air is often admitted.</p>

<p class="normal">Himself unseen for the moment--since, as he entered the room,
a wrangle had suddenly sprung up among all at the table over the disputed
ownership of a certain stake--he stared in amazement into the gloomy den. Yet
that amazement was not occasioned by the place itself (he had seen worse, or at
least as bad, in other lands), but by the face of a man who was seated behind
the half-caste girl acting as croupier, evidently under his directions.</p>

<p class="normal">Where had he seen that face, or one like it, before? That was
what he was asking himself now; that was what was causing his amazement!</p>

<p class="normal">Where? Where? For the features were known to him--the face was
familiar, some trick or turn in it was not strange.</p>

<p class="normal">Where had he done so, and what did it mean?</p>

<p class="normal">Almost he was appalled, dismayed, at the sight of that face.
The nose straight, the eyes full and clear, the chin clear cut; nothing in it
unfamiliar to him except a certain cruel, determined look that he did not
recognise.</p>

<p class="normal">The dispute waxed stronger between the gamblers; the
half-caste girl laughed and chattered like one of the monkeys outside in the
woods, and beat the table more than once with her lithe, sinuous hand and
summoned them to put down fresh stakes, to recommence the game; the men
squabbled and wrangled between themselves, and one pointed significantly to his
blouse--open at the breast; so significantly, indeed, that none who saw the
action could doubt what there was inside that blouse, lying ready to his right
hand.</p>

<p class="normal">That action of the man--a little wizened fellow, himself half
Spaniard, half Indian, with perhaps a drop or two of the tar-bucket also in his
veins--brought things to an end, to a climax.</p>

<p class="normal">For the other man whose face was puzzling Julian Ritherdon's
brain, and puzzling him with a bewilderment that was almost weird and uncanny,
suddenly sprang up from beside, or rather behind, the girl croupier and cried--</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Stop it! Cease, I say. It is you, Jaime, you who always makes
these disputes. Come! I'll have no more of it. And keep your hand from the
pistol or----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">But his threat was ended by his action, which was to seize the
man he had addressed by the scruff of his neck, after which he commenced to haul
him towards the door.</p>

<p class="normal">Then he--then all of them--saw the intruder, Julian Ritherdon,
standing there by that door, looking at them calmly and unruffled--calm and
unruffled, that is to say, except for his bewilderment at the sight of the other
man's face.</p>

<p class="normal">They all saw him in a moment as they turned, and in a moment a
fresh uproar, a new disturbance, arose; a disturbance that seemed to bode
ominously for Julian. For, now, in each man's hands there was a revolver, drawn
like lightning from the breast of each shirt or blouse.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Who are you? What are you?&quot; all cried together, except the
girl, who was busily sweeping up the gold and silver on the table into her
pockets. &quot;Who? One of the constabulary from Belize? A spy! Shoot him!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No,&quot; exclaimed the man who bore the features that so amazed
Julian Ritherdon, &quot;no, this is not one of the constabulary;&quot; while, as he spoke,
his eyes roved over the tropical naval clothes, or &quot;whites,&quot; in which the former
was clad for coolness. &quot;Neither do I believe he is a spy. Yet,&quot; he continued,
&quot;what are you doing here? Who are you?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Neither their pistols nor their cries had any power to alarm
Julian, who, young as he was, had already won the Egyptian medal and the Albert
medal for saving life; wherefore, looking his interrogator calmly in the face,
he said--</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I am on a visit to the colony, and my name is Julian
Ritherdon.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Julian Ritherdon!&quot; the other exclaimed, &quot;Julian Ritherdon!&quot;
and as he spoke the owner of that name could see the astonishment on all their
faces. &quot;Julian Ritherdon,&quot; he repeated again.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;That is it. Doubtless you know it hereabouts. May I be so
bold as to ask what yours is?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">The man gave a hard, dry laugh--a strange laugh it was, too;
then he replied, &quot;Certainly you may. Especially as mine is by chance much the
same as your own. My name is Sebastian Leigh Ritherdon.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What! Your name is Ritherdon? You a Ritherdon? Who in
Heaven's name are you, then?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I happen to be the owner of a property near here called
Desolada. The owner, because I am the son of the late Mr. Ritherdon and of his
wife, Isobel Leigh, who died after giving me birth!&quot;</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="div1_05" href="#div1Ref_05">CHAPTER V.</a></h4>

<h5>&quot;A HALF-BREED NAMED ZARA.&quot;</h5>
<br>

<p class="normal">To describe Julian as being
startled--amazed--would not convey the actual state of mind into which the
answer given by the man who said that his name was Sebastian Leigh Ritherdon,
plunged him.</p>

<p class="normal">It was indeed something more than that; something more
resembling a shock of consternation which now took possession of him.</p>

<p class="normal">What did it mean?--he asked himself, even as he stood face to
face with that other bearer of the name of Ritherdon. What? And to this question
he could find but one answer: his uncle in England must, for some reason--the
reason being in all probability that his hatred for the deceit practised on him
years ago had never really become extinguished--have invented the whole story.
Yet, of what use such an invention! How could he hope that he, Julian, should
profit by such a fabrication, by such a falsehood; why should he have bidden him
go forth to a distant country there to assert a claim which could never be
substantiated?</p>

<p class="normal">Then, even in that moment, while still he stood astounded
before the other Ritherdon, there flashed into his mind a second thought,
another supposition; the thought that George Ritherdon had been a madman. That
was--must be--the solution. None but a madman would have conceived such a story.
If it were untrue!</p>

<p class="normal">Yet, now, he could not pursue this train of thought; he must
postpone reflection for the time being; he had to act, to speak, to give some
account of himself. As to who he was, who, bearing the name of Ritherdon, had
suddenly appeared in the very spot where Ritherdon was such a well-known and,
probably, such an influential name.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I never knew,&quot; the man who had announced himself as being the
heir of the late Mr. Ritherdon was saying now, &quot;that there were any other
Ritherdons in existence except my late father and myself; except myself now
since his death. And,&quot; he continued, &quot;it is a little strange, perhaps, that I
should learn such to be the case here in Honduras. Is it not?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">As he spoke to Julian, both his tone and manner were such as
would not have produced an unfavourable impression upon any one who was witness
to them. At the gaming-table, when seated behind the half-caste girl, his
appearance would have probably been considered by some as sinister, while, when
he had fallen upon the disputatious gambler, and had commenced--very roughly to
hustle him towards the door, he had presented the appearance of a hectoring
bully. Also, his first address to Julian on discovering him in the room had been
by no means one that promised well for the probable events of the next few
moments. But now--now--his manner and whole bearing were in no way aggressive,
even though his words expressed that a certain doubt in his mind accompanied
them.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Surely,&quot; he continued, &quot;we must be connections of some sort.
The presence of a Ritherdon in Honduras, within an hour's ride of my property,
must be owing to something more than coincidence.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is owing to something more than coincidence,&quot; Julian
replied, scorning to take refuge in an absolute falsehood, though acknowledging
to himself that, in the position in which he now found himself--and until he
could think matters out more clearly, as well as obtain some light on the
strange circumstances in which he was suddenly involved--diplomacy if not
evasion--a hateful word!--was necessary.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;More than coincidence. You may have heard of George
Ritherdon, your uncle, who once lived here in the colony with your father.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes,&quot; Sebastian Ritherdon answered, his eyes still on the
other. &quot;Yes, I have heard my father speak of him. Yet, that was years ago.
Nearly thirty, I think. Is he here, too? In the colony?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No; he is dead. But I am his son. And, being on leave from my
profession, which is that of an officer in her Majesty's navy, it has suited me
to pay a visit to a place of which he had spoken so often.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">As he gave this answer, Julian was able to console himself
with the reflection that, although there was evasion in it, at least there was
no falsehood. For had he not always believed himself to be George Ritherdon's
son until a month or so ago; had he not been brought up and entered for the navy
as his son? Also, was he sure now that he was
<i>not</i> his son? He had listened to a story from the dying man telling how
he, Julian, had been kidnapped from his father's house, and how the latter had
been left childless and desolate; yet now, when he was almost at the threshold
of that house, he found himself face to face with a man, evidently well known in
all the district, who proclaimed himself to be the actual son--a man who also
gave, with some distinctness in his tone, the name of Isobel Leigh as that of
his mother. She Sebastian Ritherdon's mother! the woman who was, he had been
told, his own mother: the woman who, dying in giving birth to her first son,
could consequently have never been the mother of a second. Was it not well,
therefore, that, as he had always been, so he should continue to be, certainly
for the present, the son of George Ritherdon, and not of Charles? For, to
proclaim himself here, in Honduras, as the offspring of the latter would be to
bring down upon him, almost of a surety, the charge of being an impostor.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I knew,&quot; exclaimed Sebastian, while in his look and manner
there was expressed considerable cordiality; &quot;I knew we must be akin. I was
certain of it. Even as you stood in that doorway, and as the ray of sunlight
streamed across the room, I felt sure of it before you mentioned your name.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Why?&quot; asked Julian surprised; perhaps, too, a little
agitated.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Why! Can you not understand? Not recognise why--at once? Man
alive!
<i>We are alike!</i>&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Alike! Alike! The words fell on Julian with startling force.
Alike! Yes, so they were! They were alike. And in an instant it seemed as if
some veil, some web had fallen away from his mental vision; as if he understood
what had hitherto puzzled him. He understood his bewilderment as to where he had
seen that face and those features before! For now he knew. He had seen them in
the looking-glass!</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No doubt about the likeness!&quot; exclaimed one of the gamblers
who had remained in the room, a listener to the conference; while the half-breed
stared from first one face to the other with her large eyes wide open. &quot;No doubt
about that. As much like brothers as cousins, I should say.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">And the girl who (since Julian's intrusion, and since, also,
she had discovered that it was not the constabulary from Belize who had suddenly
raided their gambling den), had preserved a stolid silence--glancing ever and
anon with dusky eyes at each, muttered also that none who saw those two men
together could doubt that they were kinsmen, or, as she termed it, <i>parienti</i>.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes,&quot; Julian answered bewildered, almost stunned, as one
thing after another seemed--with crushing force--to be sweeping away for ever
all possibility of George Ritherdon's story having had any foundation in fact,
any likelihood of being aught else but the chimera of a distraught brain; &quot;yes,
I can perceive it. I--I--wondered where I had seen your face before, when I
first entered the room. Now I know.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And,&quot; Sebastian exclaimed, slapping his newly found kinsmen
somewhat boisterously on the back, &quot;and we are cousins. So much the better! For
my part I am heartily glad to meet a relation. Now--come--let us be off to
Desolada. You were on your way there, no doubt. Well! you shall have a cordial
welcome. The best I can offer. You know that the Spaniards always call their
house 'their guests' house.' And my house shall be yours. For as long as you
like to make it so.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You are very good,&quot; Julian said haltingly, feeling, too, that
he was no longer master of himself, no longer possessed of all that ease which
he had, until to-day, imagined himself to be in full possession of. &quot;Very good
indeed. And what you say is the case. I was on my way--I--had a desire to see
the place in which your and my father lived.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You shall see it, you shall be most welcome. And,&quot; Sebastian
continued, &quot;you will find it big enough. It is a vast rambling place, half wood,
half brick, constructed originally by Spanish settlers, so that it is over a
hundred years old. The name is a mournful one, yet it has always been retained.
And once it was appropriate enough. There was scarcely another dwelling near it
for miles--as a matter of fact, there are hardly any now. The nearest, which is
a place called 'La Superba,' is five miles farther on.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">They went out together now to the front of the inn--Julian
observing that still the negro slept on in the entrance-hall and still the dog
slept on in the sun outside--and here Sebastian, finding the good-looking horse,
began to untether it, while Julian did the same for his mustang. They were the
only two animals now left standing in the shade thrown by the house, since all
the men--including he who had stayed last and listened to their
conversation--were gone. The girl, however, still remained, and to her Sebastian
spoke, bidding her make her way through the bypaths of the forest to Desolada
and state that he and his guest were coming.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Who is she?&quot; asked Julian, feeling that it was incumbent on
him to evince some interest in this new-found &quot;cousin's&quot; affairs; while, as was
not surprising, he really felt too dazed to heed much that was passing around
him. The astonishment, the bewilderment that had fallen on him owing to the
events of the last half-hour, the startling information he had received, all of
which tended, if it did anything, to disprove every word that George Ritherdon
had uttered prior to his death--were enough to daze a man of even cooler
instincts than he possessed.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;She,&quot; said Sebastian, with a half laugh, a laugh in which
contempt was strangely discernible, &quot;she, oh! she's a half-breed--Spanish and
native mixed--named Zara. She was born on our place and turns her hand to
anything required, from milking the goats to superintending the negroes.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;She seems to know how to turn her hand to a roulette wheel
also,&quot; Julian remarked, still endeavouring to frame some sentences which should
pass muster for the ordinary courteous attention expected from a newly found
relation, who had also, now, assumed the character of guest.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes,&quot; Sebastian answered. &quot;Yes, she can do that too. I
suppose you were surprised at finding all the implements of a gambling room
here! Yet, if you lived in the colony it would not seem so strange. We planters,
especially in the wild parts, must have some amusement, even though it's
illegal. Therefore, we meet three times a week at the inn, and the man who is
willing to put down the most money takes the bank. It happened to me to-day.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And, as in the case of most hot countries,&quot; said Julian,
forcing himself to be interested, &quot;a servant is used for that portion of the
game which necessitates exertion. I understand! In some tropical countries I
have known, men bring their servants to deal for them at whist and mark their
game.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You have seen a great deal of the world as a sailor?&quot; the
other asked, while they now wended their way through a thick mangrove wood in
which the monkeys and parrots kept up such an incessant chattering that they
could scarcely hear themselves talk.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I have been round it three times,&quot; Julian replied; &quot;though,
of course, sailor-like, I know the coast portions of different countries much
better than I do any of the interiors.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And I have never been farther away than New Orleans. My
mother ca--my mother always wanted to go there and see it.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Was she--your mother from New Orleans?&quot; Julian asked, on the
alert at this moment, he hardly knew why.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;My mother. Oh! no. She was the daughter of Mr. Leigh, an
English merchant at Belize. But, as you will discover, New Orleans means the
world to us--we all want to go there sometimes.&quot;</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="div1_06" href="#div1Ref_06">CHAPTER VI.</a></h4>

<h5>&quot;KNOWLEDGE IS NOT ALWAYS PROOF.&quot;</h5>

<p class="normal">If there was one desire more paramount than another in
Julian's mind--as now they threaded a campeachy wood dotted here and there with
clumps of cabbage palms while, all around, in the underbrush and pools, the
Caribbean lily grew in thick and luxurious profusion--that desire was to be
alone. To be able to reflect and to think uninterruptedly, and without being
obliged at every moment to listen to his companion's flow of conversation--which
was so unceasing that it seemed forced--as well as obliged to answer questions
and to display an interest in all that was being said.</p>

<p class="normal">Julian felt, perhaps, this desire the more strongly because,
by now, he was gradually becoming able to collect himself, to adjust his
thoughts and reflections and, thereby, to bring a more calm and clear insight to
bear upon the discovery--so amazing and surprising--which had come to his
knowledge but an hour or so ago. If he were alone now, he told himself, if he
could only get half-an-hour's entire and uninterrupted freedom for thought, he
could, he felt sure, review the matter with coolness and judgment. Also, he
could ponder over one or two things which, at this moment, struck him with a
force they had not done at the time when they had fallen with stunning--because
unexpected--force upon his brain. Things--namely words and statements--that
might go far towards explaining, if not towards unravelling, much that had
hitherto seemed inexplicable.</p>

<p class="normal">Yet, all the same, he was obliged to confess to himself that
one thing seemed absolutely incapable of explanation. That was, how this man
could be the child of Charles Ritherdon, the late owner of the vast property
through which they were now riding, if his brother George had been neither
demented nor a liar. And that Sebastian should have invented his statement was
obviously incredible for the plain and simple reasons that he had made it before
several witnesses, and that he was in full possession, as recognised heir, of
all that the dead planter had left behind.</p>

<p class="normal">It was impossible, however, that he could meditate--and,
certainly, he could not follow any train of thought--amid the unfailing flow of
conversation in which his companion indulged. That flow gave him the impression,
as it must have given any other person who might by chance have overheard it,
that it was conversation made for conversation's sake, or, in other words, made
with a determination to preclude all reflection on Julian's part. From one thing
to another this man, called Sebastian Ritherdon, wandered--from the trade of the
colony to its products and vegetation, to the climate, the melancholy and
loneliness of life in the whole district, the absence of news and of excitement,
the stagnation of everything except the power of making money by exportation.
Then, when all these topics appeared to be thoroughly beaten out and exhausted,
Sebastian Ritherdon recurred to a remark made during the earlier part of their
ride, and said:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;So you have a letter of introduction to the Sprangers? Well!
you should present it. Old Spranger is a pleasant, agreeable man, while as for
Beatrix, his daughter, she is a beautiful girl. Wasted here, though.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Is she?&quot; said Julian. &quot;Are there, then, no eligible men in
British Honduras who could prevent a beautiful girl from failing in what every
beautiful girl hopes to accomplish--namely getting well settled?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Oh, yes!&quot; the other answered, and now it seemed to Julian as
though in his tone there was something which spoke of disappointment, if not of
regret, personal to the man himself. &quot;Oh, yes! There are such men among us. Men
well-to-do, large owners of remunerative estates, capitalists employing a good
deal of labour, and so forth. Only--only----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Only what?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Well--oh! I don't know; perhaps we are not quite her class,
her style. In England the Sprangers are somebody, I believe, and Beatrix is
consequently rather difficult to please. At any rate I know she has rejected
more than one good offer. She will never marry any colonist.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Then, as Julian turned his eyes on Sebastian Ritherdon, he
felt as sure as if the man had told him so himself that he was one of the
rejected.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I intend to present that letter of introduction, you know,&quot;
he said a moment later. &quot;In fact I intended to do so from the first. Now, your
description of Miss Spranger makes me the more eager.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You may suit her,&quot; the other replied. &quot;I mean, of course, as
a friend, a companion. You are a naval officer, consequently a gentleman in
manners, a man of the world and of society. As for us, well, we may be
gentlemen, too, only we don't, of course, know much about society manners.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He paused a moment--it was indeed the longest pause he had
made for some time; then he said, &quot;When do you propose to go to see them?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I rather thought I would go back to Belize to-morrow,&quot; Julian
answered.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;To-morrow!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes. I--I--feel I ought not to be in the country and not
present that letter.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;To-morrow!&quot; Sebastian Ritherdon said again. &quot;To-morrow! That
won't give me much of your society. And I'm your cousin.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Oh!&quot; said Julian, forcing a smile, &quot;you will have plenty of
that--of my society--I'm afraid. I have a long leave, and if you will have me, I
will promise to weary you sufficiently before I finally depart. You will be
tired enough of me ere then.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">To his surprise--since nothing that the other said (and not
even the fact that the man was undoubtedly regarded by all who knew him as the
son and heir of Mr. Ritherdon and was in absolute fact in full possession of the
rights of such an heir) could make Julian believe that his presence was a
welcome one--to his surprise, Sebastian Ritherdon greeted his remark with
effusion. None who saw his smile, and the manner in which his face lit up, could
have doubted that the other's promise to stay as his guest for a considerable
time gave him the greatest pleasure.</p>

<p class="normal">Then, suddenly, while he was telling Julian so, they emerged
from one more glade, leaving behind them all the chattering members of the
animal and feathered world, and came out into a small open plain which was in a
full state of cultivation, while Julian observed a house, large, spacious and
low before them.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;There is Desolada--the House of Desolation as my poor father
used to call it, for some reason of his own--there is my property, to which you
will always be welcome.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">His property! Julian thought, even as he gazed upon the
mansion (for such it was); his property! And he had left England, had travelled
thousands of miles to reach it, thinking that, instead, it was <i>his</i>. That
he would find it awaiting an owner--perhaps in charge of some Government
official, but still awaiting an owner--himself. Yet, now, how different all was
from what he had imagined--how different! In England, on the voyage, the journey
from New York to New Orleans, nay! until four hours ago, he thought that he
would have but to tell his story after taking a hasty view of Desolada and its
surroundings to prove that he was the son who had suddenly disappeared a day or
so after his birth: to show that he was the missing, kidnapped child. He would
have but to proclaim himself and be acknowledged.</p>

<p class="normal">But, lo! how changed all appeared now. There was no missing,
kidnapped heir--there could not be if the man by his side had spoken the
truth--and how could he have spoken untruthfully here, in this country, in this
district, where a falsehood such as that statement would have been (if not
capable of immediate and universal corroboration), was open to instant denial?
There must be hundreds of people in the colony who had known Sebastian Ritherdon
from his infancy; every one in the colony would have been acquainted with such a
fact as the kidnapping of the wealthy Mr. Ritherdon's heir if it had ever taken
place, and, in such circumstances, there could have been no Sebastian. Yet here
he was by Julian's side escorting him to his own house, proclaiming himself the
owner of that house and property. Surely it was impossible that the statement
could be untrue!</p>

<p class="normal">Yet, if true, who was he himself? What! What could he be but a
man who had been used by his dying father as one who, by an imposture, might be
made the instrument of a long-conceived desire for vengeance--a vengeance to be
worked out by fraud? A man who would at once have been branded as an impostor
had he but made the claim he had quitted England with the intention of making.</p>

<p class="normal">Under the palms--which grew in groves and were used as
shade-trees--beneath the umbrageous figs, through a garden in which the
oleanders flowered luxuriously, and the plants and mignonette-trees perfumed
deliciously the evening air, while flamboyants--bearing masses of scarlet,
bloodlike flowers--allamandas, and temple-plants gave a brilliant colouring to
the scene, they rode up to the steps of the house, around the whole of which
there was a wooden balcony. Standing upon that balcony, which was made to
traverse the vast mansion so that, no matter where the sun happened to be, it
could be avoided, was a woman, smiling and waving her hand to Sebastian,
although it seemed that, in the salutation, the newcomer was included. A woman
who, in the shadow which enveloped her, since now the sun had sunk away to the
back, appeared so dark of complexion as to suggest that in her veins there ran
the dark blood of Africa.</p>

<p class="normal">Yet, a moment later, as Sebastian Ritherdon presented Julian
to her, terming him &quot;a new-found cousin,&quot; the latter was able to perceive that
the shadows of the coming tropical night had played tricks with him. In this
woman's veins there ran no drop of black blood; instead, she was only a dark,
handsome Creole--one who, in her day, must have been even more than
handsome--must have possessed superb beauty.</p>

<p class="normal">But that day had passed now, she evidently being near her
fiftieth year, though the clear ivory complexion, the black curling hair, in
which scarcely a grey streak was visible, the soft rounded features and the dark
eyes, still full of lustre, proclaimed distinctly what her beauty must have been
in long past days. Also, Julian noticed, as she held out a white slim hand and
murmured some words of cordial welcome to him, that her figure, lithe and
sinuous, was one that might have become a woman young enough to have been her
daughter. Only--he thought--it was almost too lithe and sinuous: it reminded him
too much of a tiger he had once stalked in India, and of how he had seen the
striped body creeping in and out of the jungle.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;This is Madame Carmaux,&quot; Sebastian said to Julian, as the
latter bowed before her, &quot;a relation of my late mother. She has been here many
years--even before that mother died. And--she has been one to me as well as
fulfilling all the duties of the lady of the house both for my father and, now,
for myself.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Then, after Julian had muttered some suitable words and had
once more received a gracious smile from the owner of those dark eyes, Sebastian
said, &quot;Now, you would like to make some kind of toilette, I suppose, before the
evening meal. Come, I will show you your room.&quot; And he led the way up the vast
campeachy-wood staircase to the floor above.</p>

<p class="normal">Tropical nights fall swiftly directly the sun has disappeared,
as it had now done behind the still gilded crests of the Cockscomb range, and
Julian, standing on his balcony after the other had left him and gazing out on
all around, wondered what was to be the outcome of this visit to Honduras. He
pondered, too, as he had pondered before, whether George Ritherdon had in truth
been a madman or one who had plotted a strange scheme of revenge against his
brother; a scheme which now could never be perfected. Or--for he mused on this
also--had George Ritherdon spoken the truth, had Sebastian----</p>

<p class="normal">The current of his thoughts was broken, even as he arrived at
this point, by hearing beneath him on the under balcony the voice of Sebastian
speaking in tones low but clear and distinct--by hearing that voice say, as
though in answer to another's question:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Know--of course he must know! But knowledge is not always
proof.&quot;</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="div1_07" href="#div1Ref_07">CHAPTER VII.</a></h4>

<h5>MADAME CARMAUX TAKES A NAP</h5>
<br>

<p class="normal">On that night when Sebastian Ritherdon
escorted Julian once more up the great campeachy-wood staircase to the room
allotted to him, he had extorted a promise from his guest that he would stay at
least one day before breaking his visit by another to Sprangers.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;For,&quot; he had said before, down in the vast dining-room--which
would almost have served for a modern Continental hotel--and now said again ere
he bid his cousin &quot;good-night,&quot; &quot;for what does one day matter? And, you know,
you can return to Belize twice as fast as you came here.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;How so?&quot; asked Julian, while, as he spoke, his eyes were
roaming round the great desolate corridors of the first floor, and he was,
almost unknowingly to himself, peering down those corridors amid the shadows
which the lamp that Sebastian carried scarcely served to illuminate. &quot;How so?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Why, first, you know your road now. Then, next, I can mount
you on a good swift trotting horse that will do the journey in a third of the
time that mustang took to get you along. How ever did you become possessed of
such a creature? We rarely see them here.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I hired it from the man who kept the hotel. He said it was
the proper thing to do the journey with.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Proper thing, indeed! More proper to assist the bullocks and
mules in transporting the mahogany and campeachy, or the fruits, from the
interior to the coast. However, you shall have a good trotting Spanish horse to
take you into Belize, and I'll send your creature back later.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Then, after wishing each other good-night, Julian entered the
room, Sebastian handing him the lamp he had carried upstairs to light the way.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I can find my own way down again in the dark very well,&quot; the
latter said. &quot;I ought to be able to do so in the house I was born in and have
lived in all my life. Good-night.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">At last Julian was alone. Alone with some hours before him in
which he could reflect and meditate on the occurrences of this eventful day.</p>

<p class="normal">He did now that which perhaps, every man, no matter how
courageous he might have been, would have done in similar circumstances. He made
a careful inspection of the room, looking into a large wardrobe which stood in
the corner, and, it must be admitted, under the bed also; which, as is the case
in most tropical climates, stood in the middle of the room, so that the
mosquitoes that harboured in the whitewashed walls should have less opportunity
of forcing their way through the gauze nets which protected the bed. Then,
having completed this survey to his satisfaction, he put his hand into his
breast and drew from a pocket inside his waistcoat that which, it may well be
surmised, he was not very likely to be without here. This was an express
revolver.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;That's all right,&quot; he said as, after a glance at the
chambers, he laid it on the table by his side. &quot;You have been of use before, my
friend, in other parts of the world and, although you are not likely to be
wanted here, you don't take up much room.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Now,&quot; he went on to himself, &quot;for a good long think, as the
paymaster of the Mongoose always used to say before he fell asleep in the
wardroom and drove everybody else out of it with his snores. Only, first there
are one or two other little things to be done.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Whereon he walked out on to the balcony--the windows of course
being open--and gave a long and searching glance around, above, and below him.
Below, to where was the veranda of the lower or ground floor, with, standing
about, two or three Singapore chairs covered with chintz, a small table and,
upon it, a bottle of spirits and some glasses as well as a large carafe of
water. All these things were perfectly visible because, from the room beneath
him, there streamed out a strong light from the oil lamp which stood on the
table within that room, while, even though such had not been the case, Julian
was perfectly well aware that they were there.</p>

<p class="normal">He and Sebastian had sat in those chairs for more than an hour
talking after the evening meal, while Madame Carmaux, whose other name he learnt
was Miriam, had sat in another, perusing by the light of the lamp the Belize
Advertiser. Yet, now and again, it had seemed to Julian as though, while those
dark eyes had been fixed on the sheet, their owner's attention had been
otherwise occupied, or else that she read very slowly. For once, when he had
been giving a very guarded description of George Ritherdon's life in England
during the last few years, he had seen them rest momentarily upon his face, and
then be quickly withdrawn. Also, he had observed, the newspaper had never been
turned once.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Now,&quot; he said again to himself, &quot;now, let us think it all out
and come to some decision as to what it all means. Let us see. Let me go over
everything that has happened since I pulled up outside that inn--or gambling
house!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He was, perhaps, a little more methodical than most young men;
the habit being doubtless born of many examinations at Greenwich, of a long
course in H.M.S. Excellent, and, possibly, of the fact that he had done what
sailors call a lot of &quot;logging&quot; in his time, both as watchkeeper and when in
command of a destroyer. Therefore, he drew from his pocket a rather large, but
somewhat unbusinesslike-looking pocketbook--since it was bound in crushed
morocco and had its leaves gilt-edged--and, ruthlessly tearing out a sheet of
paper, he withdrew the pencil from its place and prepared to make notes.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No orders as to 'lights out,'&quot; he muttered to himself before
beginning. &quot;I suppose I may sit up as long as I like.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Then, after a few moments' reflection, he jotted down:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;S. didn't seem astonished to see me. (Qy?) Ought to have done
so, if I came as a surprise to him. Can't ever have heard of me before.
Consequently it was a surprise. Said who he was, and was particularly careful to
say who his mother was, viz. I. S. R. (Qy?) Isn't that odd? Known many people
who tell you who their father was. Never knew 'em lug in their mother's name,
though, except when very swagger. Says Madame Carmaux relative of his mother,
yet Isobel Leigh was daughter of English planter. C's not a full-bred
Englishwoman, and her name's French. That's nothing, though. Perhaps married a
Frenchman.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">These little notes--which filled the detached sheet of the
ornamental pocketbook--being written down, Julian, before taking another, sat
back in his chair to ponder; yet his musings were not satisfactory, and, indeed,
did not tend to enlighten him very much, which, as a matter of fact, they were
not very likely to do.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He must be the <i>right</i> man, after all, and I must be the
wrong one,&quot; he said to himself. &quot;It is impossible the thing can be otherwise. A
child kidnapped would make such a sensation in a place like this that the affair
would furnish gossip for the next fifty years. Also, if a child was kidnapped,
how on earth has this man grown up here and now inherited the property? If I was
actually the child I certainly didn't grow up here, and if he was the child and
did grow up here then there was no kidnapping.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Indeed, by the time that Julian had arrived at this rather
complicated result, he began to feel that his brain was getting into a whirl,
and he came to a hasty resolution. That resolution was that he would abandon
this business altogether; that, on the next day but one, he would go to Belize
and pay his visit to the Sprangers, while, when that visit was concluded, he
would, instead of returning to Desolada, set out on his return journey to
England.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Even though my uncle--if he was my uncle and not my
father--spoke the truth and told everything exactly as it occurred, how is it to
be proved? How can any legal power on earth dispossess a man who has been
brought up here from his infancy, in favour of one who comes without any
evidence in his favour, since that certificate of my baptism in New Orleans,
although it states me to be the son of the late owner of this place, cannot be
substantiated? Any man might have taken any child and had such an entry as that
made. And if he--he my uncle, or my father--could conceive such a scheme as he
revealed to me--or <i>such a scheme as he did not reveal to me</i>--then, the
entry at New Orleans would not present much difficulty to one like him. It is
proof--proof that it be----&quot; He stopped in his meditations--stopped, wondering
where he had heard something said about &quot;proof&quot; before on this evening.</p>

<p class="normal">Then, in a moment, he recalled the almost whispered words; the
words that in absolute fact were whispered from the balcony below, before he
went down to take his seat at the supper table; the utterance of Sebastian:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Know--of course he must know. But knowledge is not always
proof.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">How strange it was, he thought, that, while he had been
indulging in his musings, jotting down his little facts on the sheet of paper,
he should have forgotten those words.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Knowledge is not always proof.&quot; What knowledge? Whose? Whose
could it be but his! Whose knowledge that was not proof had Sebastian referred
to? Then again, in a moment--again suddenly--he came to another determination,
another resolve. He did possess some knowledge that this man, Sebastian could
not dispute--for it would have been folly to imagine he had been speaking of any
one else but him--though he had no proof. So be it, only, now, he would
endeavour to discover a proof that should justify such knowledge. He would not
slink away from the colony until he had exhausted every attempt to discover that
proof. If it was to be found he would find it.</p>

<p class="normal">Perhaps, after all, his uncle was his uncle, perhaps that
uncle had undoubtedly uttered the truth.</p>

<p class="normal">He rose now, preparing to go to bed, and as he did so a slight
breeze rattled the slats of the green persianas, or, as they are called in
England, Venetian blinds--a breeze that in tropical land often rises as the
night goes on. It was a cooling pleasant one, and he remembered that he had
heard it rustling the slats before, when he was engaged in making his notes.</p>

<p class="normal">Yet, now, regarding those green strips of wood, he felt a
little astonished at what he saw. He had carefully let the blinds of both
windows down and turned the laths so that neither bats nor moths, nor any of the
flying insect world which are the curse of the tropics at night, should force
their way in, attracted by the flame of the lamp; but now, one of those laths
was turned--turned, so that, instead of being downwards and forming with the
others a compact screen from the outside, it was in a flat or horizontal
position, leaving an open space of an inch between it and the one above and the
next below. A slat that was above five feet from the bottom of the blind.</p>

<p class="normal">He stood there regarding it for a moment; then, dropping the
revolver into his pocket, he went towards the window and with his finger and
thumb put back the lath into the position he had originally placed it, feeling
as he did so that it did not move smoothly, but, instead, a little stiffly.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;There has been no wind coming up from the sea that would do
that,&quot; he reflected, &quot;and, if it had come, then it would have turned more than
one. I wonder whether,&quot; and now he felt a slight sensation of creepiness coming
over him, &quot;if I had raised my eyes as I sat writing, I should have met another
pair of eyes looking in on me. Very likely. The turning of that one lath made a
peep-hole.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He pulled the blind up now without any attempt at concealing
the noise it caused--that well-known clatter made by such blinds as they are
hastily drawn up--and walked out on to the long balcony and peered over on to
the one beneath, seeing that Madame Carmaux was asleep in the wicker chair which
she had sat in during the evening, and that the newspaper lay in her lap. He
saw, too, that Sebastian Ritherdon was also sitting in his chair, but that,
aroused by the noise of the blind, he had bent his body backwards over the
veranda rail and, with upturned face, was regarding the spot at which Julian
might be expected to appear.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Not gone to bed, yet, old fellow,&quot; he called out now, on
seeing the other lean over the balcony rail; while Julian observed that Madame
Carmaux opened her eyes with a dazzled look--the look which those have on their
faces who are suddenly startled out of a light nap.</p>

<p class="normal">And for some reason--since he was growing suspicious--he
believed that look to have been assumed as well as the slumber which had
apparently preceded it.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="div1_08" href="#div1Ref_08">CHAPTER VIII.</a></h4>

<h5>A MIDNIGHT VISITOR</h5>
<br>

<p class="normal">&quot;Not yet,&quot; Julian called down in answer to
the other's remark, &quot;though I am going directly. Only it is so hot. I hope I am
not disturbing the house.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Not at all. Do what you like. We often sit here till long
after midnight, since it is the only cool time of the twenty-four hours. Will
you come down again and join us?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No, if you'll excuse me. I'll take a turn or two here and
then go to bed.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Whereon as he spoke, he began to walk up and down the balcony.</p>

<p class="normal">It ran (as has been said of the lower one on which Sebastian
and Madame Carmaux were seated) round the whole of the house, so that, had
Julian desired to do so, he could have commenced a tour of the building which,
by being continued, would eventually have brought him back to the spot where he
now was. He contented himself, however, with commencing to walk towards the
right-hand corner of the great rambling mansion, proceeding as far upon it as
led to where the balcony turned at the angle, then, after a glance down its--at
that place--darkened length, he retraced his steps, meaning to proceed to the
opposite or left-hand corner.</p>

<p class="normal">Doing so, however, and coming thus in front of his bedroom
window, from which, since the blind was up, the light of his lamp streamed out
on to the broad wooden floor of the balcony, he saw lying at his feet a small
object which formed a patch of colour on the dark boards. A patch which was of a
pale roseate hue, the thing being, indeed, a little spray, now dry and faded, of
the oleander flower. And he knew, felt sure, where he had seen that spray
before.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I know now,&quot; he said to himself, &quot;who turned the slat--who
stood outside my window looking in on me.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Picking up the withered thing, he, nevertheless, continued his
stroll along the balcony until he arrived at the left angle of the house, when
he was able to glance down the whole of that side of it, this being as much in
the dark and unrelieved by any light from within as the corresponding right side
had been. Unrelieved, that is, by any light except the gleam of the great stars
which here glisten with an incandescent whiteness; and in that gleam he saw
sitting on the floor of the balcony--her back against the wall, her arms over
her knees and her head sunk on those arms--the half-caste girl, Zara, the
croupier of the gambling-table to which Sebastian had supplied the &quot;bank&quot; that
morning at All Pines.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You have dropped this flower from your hair,&quot; he said,
tossing it lightly down to her, while she turned up her dark, dusky eyes at him
and, picking up the withered spray, tossed it in her turn contemptuously over
the balcony. But she said nothing and, a moment later, let her head droop once
more towards her arms.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Do you pass the night here?&quot; he said now. &quot;Surely it is not
wholesome to keep out in open air like this.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I sit here often,&quot; she replied, &quot;before going to bed in my
room behind. The rooms are too warm. I disturb no one.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">For a moment he felt disposed to say that it would disturb him
if she should again take it into her head to turn his blinds, but, on second
considerations, he held his peace. To know a thing and not to divulge one's
knowledge is, he reflected, sometimes to possess a secret--a clue--a warning
worth having; to possess, indeed, something that may be of use to us in the
future if not now, while, for the rest--well! the returning of the spray to her
had, doubtless, informed the girl sufficiently that he was acquainted with the
fact of how she had been outside his window, and that it was she who had opened
his blind wide enough to allow her to peer in on him.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Good-night,&quot; he said, turning away. &quot;Good-night,&quot; and without
waiting to hear whether she returned the greeting or not, he went back to the
bedroom. Yet, before he entered it, he bent over the balcony and called down
another &quot;good-night&quot; to Sebastian, who, he noticed, had now been deserted by
Madame Carmaux.</p>

<p class="normal">For some considerable time after this he walked about his
room; long enough, indeed, to give Sebastian the idea that he was preparing for
bed, then, although he had removed none of his clothing except his boots, he put
out the lamp.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;If the young lady is desirous of observing me again,&quot; he
reflected, &quot;she can do so. Yet if she does, it will not be without my knowing
it. And if she should pay me another visit--why, we shall see.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">But, all the same, and because he thought it not at all
unlikely that some other visitor than the girl might make her way, not only to
the blind itself but even to the room, he laid his right arm along the table so
that his fingers were touching the revolver that he had now placed on that
table.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I haven't taken countless middle watches for nothing in my
time,&quot; he said to himself; &quot;another won't hurt me. If I do drop asleep, I
imagine I shall wake up pretty easily.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He was on the alert now, and not only on the alert as to any
one who might be disposed to pay him a nocturnal visit, but, also, mentally wary
as to what might be the truth concerning Sebastian Ritherdon and himself. For,
strange to say, there was a singular revulsion of feeling going on in his mind
at this time; strange because, at present, scarcely anything of considerable
importance, scarcely anything sufficiently tangible, had occurred to produce
this new conviction that Sebastian's story was untrue, and that the other story
told by his uncle before his death was the right one.</p>

<p class="normal">All the same, the conviction was growing in his mind; growing
steadily, although perhaps without any just reason or cause for its growth.
Meanwhile, his ears now told him that, although Madame Carmaux was absent when
he glanced over the balcony to wish Sebastian that last greeting, she
undoubtedly had not gone to bed. From below, in the intense stillness of the
tropic night--a stillness broken only occasionally by the cry of some bird from
the plantation beyond the cultivated gardens, he heard the soft luscious tones
of the woman herself--and those who are familiar with the tones of southern
women will recall how luscious the murmur can be; he heard, too, the deeper
notes of the man. Yet what they said to each other in subdued whispers was
unintelligible to him; beyond a word here and there nothing reached his ears.</p>

<p class="normal">With the feeling of conviction growing stronger and stronger
in his mind that there was some deception about the whole affair--that,
plausible as Sebastian's possession of all which the dead man had left behind
appeared; plausible, too, as was his undoubted position here and had been from
his very earliest days, Julian would have given much now to overhear their
conversation--a conversation which, he felt certain, in spite of it taking place
thirty feet below where he was supposed to be by now asleep, related to his
appearance on the scene.</p>

<p class="normal">Would it be possible? Could he in any way manage to thus
overhear it? If he were nearer to the persianas, his ear close to the slats, his
head placed down low, close to the boards of the room and of the balcony as
well--what might not be overheard?</p>

<p class="normal">Thinking thus, he resolved to make the attempt, even while he
told himself that in no other circumstances would he--a gentleman, a man of
honour--resort to such a scheme of prying interference. But--for still the
certainty increased in his mind that there was some deceit, some fraud in
connection with Sebastian Ritherdon's possession of Desolada and all that
Desolada represented in value--he did not hesitate now. As once he, with some of
his bluejackets, had tracked slavers from the sea for miles inland and into the
coast swamps and fever-haunted interior of the great Black Continent, so now he
would track this man's devious and doubtful existence, as, remembering George
Ritherdon's story, it seemed to him to be. If he had wronged Sebastian, if he
had formed a false estimate of his possession of this place and of his right to
the name he bore, no harm would be done. For then he would go away from Honduras
for ever, leaving the man in peaceable possession of all that was rightly his.
But, if his suspicions were not wrong----</p>

<p class="normal">He let himself down to the floor from the chair on which he
had been sitting in the dark for now nearly an hour, and, quietly, noiselessly,
he progressed along that solid floor--one so well laid in the past that no board
either creaked or made any noise--and thus he reached the balcony, there
interposing nothing now between him and it but the lowered blind.</p>

<p class="normal">Then when he had arrived there, he heard their voices plainly;
heard every word that fell from their lips--the soft murmur of the woman's
tones, the deeper, more guttural notes of the man.</p>

<p class="normal">Only--he might as well have been a mile away from where they
sat, he might as well have been stone deaf as able to thus easily overhear those
words.</p>

<p class="normal">For Sebastian and his companion were speaking in a tongue that
was unknown to him; a tongue that, in spite of the Spanish surroundings and
influences which still linger in all places forming parts of Central America,
was not Spanish. Of this language he, like most sailors, knew something;
therefore he was aware that it was not that, as well as he was aware that it was
not French. Perhaps 'twas Maya, which he had been told in Belize was the native
jargon, or Carib, which was spoken along the coast.</p>

<p class="normal">And almost, as he recognised how he was baffled, could he have
laughed bitterly at himself. &quot;What a fool I must have been,&quot; he thought, &quot;to
suppose that if they had any confidences to make to each other, any secrets to
talk over in which I was concerned they would discuss them in a language I
should be likely to understand.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">But there are some words, especially those which express
names, which cannot be translated into a foreign tongue. Among such, Ritherdon
would be one. Julian, too, is another, with only the addition of the letter &quot;o&quot;
at the end in Spanish (and perhaps also in Maya or Carib), and George, which,
though spelt Jorge, has, in speaking, nearly the same pronunciation. And these
names met his ear as did others: Inglaterra--the name of the woman Isobel Leigh,
whom Julian believed to have been his mother, but whom Sebastian asserted to
have been his; also the name of that fair American city lying to the north of
them--New Orleans--it being referred to, of course, in the Spanish tongue.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;So,&quot; he thought to himself, &quot;it is of me they are talking. Of
me--which would not, perhaps, be strange, since a guest so suddenly received
into the house and having the name of Ritherdon might well furnish food for
conversation. But, when coupled with George Ritherdon, with New Orleans, above
all with the name of Isobel Leigh----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Even as that name was in his mind, he heard it again mentioned
below by the woman--Madame Carmaux. Mentioned, too, in conjunction with and
followed by a light, subdued laugh; a laugh in which his acuteness could hear an
undercurrent of bitterness--perhaps of derision.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And she was this woman's relative,&quot; he thought, &quot;her
relative! Yet now she is jeered at, spoken scornfully of by----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">In amazement he paused, even while his reflections arrived at
this stage.</p>

<p class="normal">In front of where his eyes were, low down to the floor of the
balcony, something dark and sombre passed, then returned and stopped before him,
blotting from his eyes all that lay in front of them--the tops of the palms, the
woods beyond the garden, the dark sea beyond that. Like a pall it rested before
his vision, obscuring, blurring everything. And, a moment later, he recognised
that it was a woman's dress which thus impeded his view, while, as he did so, he
heard some five feet above him a light click made by one of the slats.</p>

<p class="normal">Then, with an upward glance of his eyes, that glance being
aided by a noiseless turn of his head, he saw that a finger was holding back the
lath, and knew--felt sure--that into the darkness of the room two other eyes
were gazing.</p>

<h5>BEATRIX</h5>
<br>

<p class="normal">Thirty-six hours later Julian Ritherdon sat
among very different surroundings from those of Desolada; certainly very
different ones from those of his first night in the gloomy, mysterious house
owned by that other man who bore his name.</p>

<p class="normal">He was seated now in a wicker chair placed beneath the cool
shadow cast by a vast clump of &quot;shade-trees,&quot; as the royal palm, the thatch
palm, and, indeed, almost every kind and species of that form of vegetation are
denominated. These shade-trees grew in the pretty and luxuriant garden of Mr.
Spranger's house on the southern outskirts of Belize, a garden in which, for
some years now, Beatrix Spranger had passed the greater part of her days, and
sometimes when the hot simoon was on, as it was now, and the temperature
scarcely ever fell below 85°, a good deal of the early part of her nights.</p>

<p class="normal">She, too, was seated in that garden now, talking to Julian,
while between them there lay two or three books and London magazines (three or
four months old), a copy of the Times of the same ancient date, and another of
the Belize Advertiser fresh from the local press. Yet neither the news from
London which had long since been published, nor that of the immediate
neighbourhood, which was quite new but not particularly exciting, seemed to have
been able to secure much of their attention. And this for a reason which was a
simple one and easily to be understood. All their attention was at the present
moment concentrated on each other.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You cannot think,&quot; Beatrix Spranger was saying now, &quot;what a
welcome event the arrival of a stranger is to us here, who regard ourselves more
or less as exiles for the time being. Moreover,&quot; she continued, without any of
that false shame which a young lady at home in England might have thought
necessary to assume, even though she did not actually feel it, &quot;it seems to me
that you are a very interesting person, Lieutenant Ritherdon. You have dropped
down into a place where your name happens to be extremely well known, yet in
which no one ever imagined that there was any other Ritherdon in existence
anywhere, except the late and the present owners of Desolada.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;People, even exiles, have relatives sometimes in other parts
of the world,&quot; Julian murmured rather languidly--the effect of the heat and the
perfume of the flowers in the garden being upon him--&quot;and you know----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Oh! yes,&quot; the girl said, with an answering smile. &quot;I do know
all that. Only I happen to know something else, too. You see we--that is, father
and I--are acquainted with your cousin, and we knew his father before him. And
it is a rather singular thing that they have always given us to understand that,
so far as they were aware, they hadn't a relation in the world.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;They had, though, you see, all the same. Indeed, they had two
until a short time ago; namely, when my father, Mr. George Ritherdon, was
alive.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Mr. Ritherdon, Sebastian's father, hadn't seen him for many
years, had he? He didn't often speak of him, and always gave people the idea
that his brother was dead. I suppose they had not parted the best of friends?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No,&quot; Julian answered quietly, &quot;I don't think they had. As a
matter of fact, my--George Ritherdon--was almost, indeed quite, as reticent
about his brother Charles as Charles seems to have been about him.&quot; Then,
suddenly changing the subject, he said: &quot;Is Sebastian popular hereabouts. Is he
liked?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No,&quot; the girl replied, rather more frankly than Julian had
expected, while, as she did so, she lifted a pair of beautiful blue eyes to his
face. &quot;No, I don't think he is, since you ask me.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Why not? You may tell me candidly, Miss Spranger, especially
as you know that to-night I am going to have a rather serious interview with
your father, and shall ask him for his advice and assistance on a matter in
which I require his counsel.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Oh! I don't know quite,&quot; the girl said now.
&quot;Only--only--well! you know--because you have told us that you saw him doing
it--he--he--is too fond of play, of gambling. People say--different things. Some
that he is ruining his brother planters, and others that he is ruining himself.
Then he has the reputation of being very hard and cruel to some of his servants.
You know, we have coolies and negroes and Caribs and natives here, and a good
many of them are bound to the employers for a term of years--and--and--well--if
one feels inclined to be cruel--they can be.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">As she spoke of this, Julian recognised how he had been within
an ace of discovering, some time before he reached the inn at All Pines, that
the late Mr. Ritherdon had not died without leaving an heir, apparent or
presumptive, as he had supposed when he landed at Belize. The negro guide on
whom he had bestowed so many good-humoured sobriquets had spoken of Mr.
Ritherdon as being a hard and cruel man, both to blacks and whites. But--in his
ignorance, which was natural enough--he had supposed that the statement could
only have applied to the one owner of Desolada of whom he had ever heard--the
man lately dead.</p>

<p class="normal">Now, he reflected, he wished he had really understood to whom
that negro referred. It might have made a difference in his plans, he thought;
might have prevented him from going on farther on the road to All Pines and
Desolada; from meeting this unexpected, unknown of, possessor of what he
believed to be his, until those plans had become more matured. Until, too, he
had had time to decide in what form, if any, he should present himself before
the man who was called Sebastian Ritherdon.</p>

<p class="normal">However, it was done. He had presented himself and, if he knew
anything of human nature, if he could read a character at all, his appearance
had caused considerable excitement in the minds of both Sebastian Ritherdon and
Madame Carmaux.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Do <i>you</i> like Sebastian?&quot; he asked now, and he could
scarcely have explained why he was anxious to hear a denial of any liking for
that person on the part of Beatrix Spranger. It may have been, he thought,
because this girl, with her soft English beauty, which the climate of British
Honduras during some years of residence had--certainly, as yet--had no power to
impair, seemed to him far too precious a thing to be wasted on a man such as
Sebastian was--rough, a gambler, and possessing cruel instincts.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Do you think I should like him?&quot; she asked in her turn, and
again the eyes which he thought were so beautiful glanced at him from beneath
their thick lashes, &quot;after what I have told you of the character he bears? What
I have told you, perhaps, far too candidly, saying more than I ought to have
done.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Do not think that,&quot; he made haste to exclaim. &quot;To-night I am
going to be even more frank with Mr. Spranger. I am going to tell him one or two
things in connection with my 'cousin,' when I ask him for his assistance and
advice, which will make your father at least imagine that I have not formed a
very favourable impression of my new-found relative.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And mayn't I be told, too--now?&quot; she asked, thoroughly
womanlike.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Not yet,&quot; he answered, with a smile. &quot;Not yet.
Later--perhaps.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Oh!&quot; she exclaimed, with something that might almost be
described as a pout. &quot;Oh! Not even after my candour about your cousin! You <i>
are</i> a man of mystery, Lieutenant Ritherdon. Why! you won't even tell us how
it happens that you arrived here from Desolada with that round your arm,&quot; and as
she spoke she directed her blue eyes to a sling around his neck in which his arm
reposed. &quot;Nor that,&quot; she added, nodding now towards his forehead, where, on the
left side, were affixed two or three pieces of sticking-plaster.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes,&quot; he said, &quot;I will tell you that. I feel, indeed, that I
ought to do so, if only as an apology for presenting myself before you in such a
guise. You see, it is so easy to explain this, that it is not worth making any
mystery about it. It all comes from the fact that I am a sailor, and sailors are
proverbial for being very bad riders,&quot; and as he spoke he accompanied his words
with another smile.</p>

<p class="normal">But Beatrix did not smile in return. Instead, she said, half
gravely, perhaps almost half severely: &quot;Go on. Lieutenant Ritherdon, if you
please. I wish to hear how the accident happened,&quot; while she added impressively,
&quot;on your journey from Desolada to Belize.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I'm a bad rider,&quot; he said again, but once more meeting her
glance, he altered his mode of speech and said:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Well, you see, Miss Spranger, it happened this way. I set out
on my journey of inspection, on my road to Desolada, on a rather ancient mustang
which the worthy landlord of the hotel with a queer Spanish name recommended to
me as the proper thing to do the journey easily on. Later, when I had made
Sebastian's acquaintance, he rather ridiculed my good Rosinante.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Did he!&quot; Beatrix interjected calmly.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He did, indeed. In fact he said such creatures were scarcely
ever used in the colony except for draught purposes. Then he said he would mount
me on a good horse of Spanish breed, such as I believe you use a great deal
here; so that when I was returning to Belize yesterday to present myself before
you and Mr. Spranger, I should be able to make the journey rapidly and
comfortably.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;That was very kind of him,&quot; Beatrix exclaimed. &quot;Though, as
you did not arrive until nine o'clock at night, you hardly seem to have made it
very rapidly, and those things,&quot; with again a glance at the sling and the
plasters, &quot;are not usually adjuncts to comfort.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Well, you see, I'm a sailor and not a good ri----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Go on, please.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, certainly. I started under favourable circumstances at
six in the morning, receiving, I believe, a kind of blessing or benediction from
Sebastian and Madame Carmaux, as well as strong injunctions to return as soon as
possible.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;People are hospitable in this country,&quot; Beatrix again
interrupted.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;We got along very well, anyhow, for a time; at a gentle trot,
of course, because already it was getting hot, and as we neared All Pines I was
just thinking of slowing down to a walk when----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;The creature bolted? Was that it?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;As a matter of fact it was. By the way, you seem to know the
manners and customs of the animals in this country, Miss Spranger.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I know that many lives are lost in this country,&quot; the girl
said gravely now, &quot;owing to unbroken horses being ridden too young horses, too,
that are sometimes full of vice. The landlord of the hotel here did you a better
service than your cousin.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Perhaps this was one of those horses,&quot; Julian remarked. &quot;But,
anyhow, it bolted. Then, a little later, it did something else. It stopped dead
in a gallop and, after nearly shooting me over its head, it reared upright and
did absolutely throw me off it backwards. Fortunately, I fell at the side of the
road onto a sort of undergrowth full of ferns and interspersed with lovely
flowering shrubs; so I got off with what you see. The horse, however, had killed
itself. It fell over on its back with a tremendous sort of backward bound and,
when I got up and looked at it, it was just dying. Later, I came on from All
Pines in a kind of cart--that is, when I had been bandaged up. Perhaps, however,
it wouldn't have happened if I had not been such a bad rider and----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It would have happened,&quot; Beatrix said, decisively, &quot;if you
had been a circus rider or a cowboy. That is, unless you had been well
acquainted with the horse, and, even then, it would probably have happened just
the same.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">After this they were silent for a little while, Julian
availing himself of Beatrix's permission to smoke, and she sitting meditatively
behind her huge fan. And, although he did not tell her so, Julian agreed with
her that the accident would probably have happened even though he had been a
circus rider or a cowboy, as she had said.</p>

<h4><a name="div1_10" href="#div1Ref_10">CHAPTER X.</a></h4>

<h5>MR. SPRANGER OBTAINS INFORMATION</h5>
<br>

<p class="normal">Mr. Spranger was at home later in the
afternoon, his business for the day being done, and in the evening they all sat
down to dinner in the now almost cool and airy dining-room of his house. And, at
this meal, Julian thought that Beatrix looked even prettier than she had done in
the blue-and-white striped dress worn by her during the day. She had on now one
of those dinner jackets which young ladies occasionally assume when not desirous
of donning the fullest of evening gowns, and, as he sat there observing the
healthy sunburn of her cheeks (which was owing to her living so much in the open
air) that contrasted markedly with the whiteness of her throat, he thought she
was one of the most lovely girls he had ever seen. Which from him, who had met
so much beauty in different parts of the world, was a very considerable
compliment--if she had but known it. Also, if the truth must be told, her
piquant shrewdness and vivacity--which she had manifested very considerably
during Julian's description of the vagaries of the animal lent to him by his
cousin--appealed very much to him, so that he could not help reflecting how,
should this girl eventually be made acquainted with all the doubts and
difficulties which now perplexed him as to his birthright, she might possibly
become a very valuable counsellor.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;She has ideas about my worthy cousin for some reason,&quot; he
thought to himself more than once during dinner, &quot;and most certainly she
suspects him of--well of not having been very careful about the mount he placed
at my disposal. So do I, as a matter of fact--only perhaps it is as well not to
say so just at present.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Moreover, now was not the time to take her into his
confidence; the evening was required for something else, namely, the counsel and
advice of her father. He had made Mr. Spranger's acquaintance overnight on his
arrival, and, in the morning of the present day, before that gentleman had
departed to his counting house in Belize, he had asked if he would, in the
evening, allow him to have his counsel on some important reasons connected with
his appearance in British Honduras. Whereon, Mr. Spranger having told him very
courteously that any advice or assistance which he could give should be at his
service, Julian knew that the time had arrived for him to take that gentleman
into his confidence. Arrived, because now, Beatrix, rising from the table, made
her way out to the lawn, where, already, a negro servant had placed a lamp on
the rustic table by which she always sat; she saying that when they had done
their conference they would find her there.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Now, my boy,&quot; said Mr. Spranger, who was a hale, jovial
Englishman, on whom neither climate nor exile had any depressing influence, and
who, besides, was delighted to have as his guest a young man who, as well as
being a gentleman, could furnish him with some news of that far-off world from
which he expected to be separated for still some years. &quot;Now, help yourself to
some more claret--it is quite sound and wholesome--and let me see what I can do
for you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It will take some time in the telling,&quot; Julian said. &quot;It is a
long story and a strange one.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It may take till midnight, if you choose,&quot; the other
answered. &quot;We sit up late in this country, so as to profit by the coolest hours
of the day.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;But--Miss Spranger. Will she not think me very rude to detain
you so long?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No,&quot; he replied. &quot;If we do not join her soon, she will
understand that our conversation is of importance.&quot;</p>
<br>

<p class="normal">It was nearly midnight when Julian had concluded the whole of his narrative, he
telling Mr. Spranger everything that had occurred from the time when George
Ritherdon had unfolded that strange story in his Surrey home, until the hour
when he himself had arrived at the house in which he now was, with his arm
bandaged up and his head dressed.</p>

<p class="normal">Of course there had been interruptions to the flow of the
narrative. Once they had gone out onto the lawn to bid Beatrix good-night and to
chat with her for a few moments during which Julian had been amply apologetic
for preventing her father from joining her, as well as for not doing so
himself--and, naturally, Mr. Spranger had himself interrupted the course of the
recital by exclamations of astonishment and with many questions.</p>

<p class="normal">But that recital was finished now, and still the elder man's
bewilderment was extreme.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is the most extraordinary story I ever heard in my life! A
romance. And it seems such a tangled web! How, in Heaven's name, can your
father's, or uncle's, account be the right one?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You do not believe his story?&quot; Julian asked; &quot;you believe
Sebastian is, in absolute fact, Charles Ritherdon's son?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What am I to believe? Just think! That young man has been
brought up here ever since he was a baby; there must be hundreds upon hundreds
of people who can recollect his birth, twenty-six years ago, his christening,
his baptism. And Charles Ritherdon--whom I knew very well indeed--recognised
him, treated him in every way, as his son. He died leaving him his heir. What
can stand against that?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Doubtless it is a mystery. Yet--yet--in spite of all, I
cannot believe that George Ritherdon would have invented such a falsehood.
Remember, Mr. Spranger, I had known him all my life and knew every side and
shade of his character. And--he was dying when he told it all to me. Would a man
go to his grave fabricating, uttering such a lie as that?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">For a moment Mr. Spranger did not reply, but sat with his eyes
turned up towards the ceiling of the room--and with, upon his face, that look
which all have seen upon the faces of those who are thinking deeply. Then at
last he said--</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Come, let us understand each other. You have asked my advice,
my opinion, as the only man you can consult freely. Now, are we to talk
frankly--am I to talk without giving offence?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;That is what I want,&quot; Julian said, &quot;what I desire. I must get
to the bottom of this mystery. Heaven knows I don't wish to claim another man's
property--I have no need for it--there is my profession and some little money
left by George Ritherdon. On the other hand, I don't desire to think of him as
dying with such a deception in his heart. I want to justify him in my eyes.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Then, because Mr. Spranger still kept silence, he said again:
&quot;Pray, pray tell me what you do think. Pray be frank. No matter what you say.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No,&quot; Mr. Spranger said now. &quot;No. Not yet at least. First let
us look at facts. I was not in the colony twenty-six years ago, but of course, I
am acquainted with scores of people who were. And those people knew old
Ritherdon as well as they know me; also they have known Sebastian all his life.
And, you must remember, there are such things as registers of births, registers
kept of baptism, and so forth. What would you say if you saw the register of
Sebastian's birth, as well as the register of your--of Mrs. Ritherdon's death?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What could I say in such circumstances? Only--why, then, the
attempt to make me break my neck on that horse? Why the half-caste girl watching
me through the night, and why the conversation which I overheard, the
contemptuous laugh of Madame Carmaux at my mother's--at Isobel Leigh's name? Why
all that, coupled with the name of George Ritherdon, of myself, of New
Orleans--where he said he had me baptized when he fled there after kidnapping
me?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">As Julian spoke, as he mentioned the name of New Orleans, he
saw a light upon Mr. Spranger's face--that look which comes upon all our faces
when something strikes us and, itself, throws a light upon our minds; also he
saw a slight start given by the elder man.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What is it?&quot; Julian asked, observing both these things.
&quot;What?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;New Orleans,&quot; Mr. Spranger said now, musingly,
contemplatively, with, about him, the manner of one endeavouring to force
recollection to come to his aid. &quot;New Orleans--and Madame Carmaux. Why do those
names--the names of that city--of that woman--connect themselves together in my
mind. Why?&quot; Then suddenly he exclaimed, &quot;I know! I have it! Madame Carmaux is a
New Orleans woman.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;A New Orleans woman!&quot; Julian repeated. &quot;A New Orleans woman!
Yet he, Sebastian, said when we met--that--that--she was a connection of Isobel
Leigh; 'a relative of my late mother,' were his words. How could she have been a
relative of hers, if Mr. Leigh came out from England to this place bringing with
him his English wife and the child that was Isobel Leigh, as George Ritherdon
told me he did? Also----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Also what?&quot; Mr. Spranger asked now. &quot;Also what? Though take
time--exert your memory to the utmost. There is something strange in the
discrepancy between George Ritherdon's statement made in England and Sebastian's
made here. What else is it that has struck you?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;This. As we rode towards Desolada he was telling me that he
had never been farther away from Honduras than New Orleans. Then he began to
say--I am sure he did--that his mother came from there, but he broke off to
modify the statement for another to the effect that she had always desired to
visit that city. And when I asked him if his mother came from New Orleans, he
said: 'Oh, no! She was the daughter of Mr. Leigh, an English merchant at
Belize.'&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You must have misunderstood him,&quot; Mr. Spranger said; &quot;have
misunderstood the first part of his remark at any rate.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Perhaps,&quot; Julian said quietly, &quot;perhaps.&quot; But, nevertheless,
he felt perfectly sure that he had not done so. Then suddenly he said--</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You knew Mr. Ritherdon of Desolada. Tell me, do I bear any
resemblance to him?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes,&quot; Mr. Spranger answered gravely, very gravely. &quot;So much
of a resemblance that you might well be his son. As great a resemblance to him
as you do in a striking manner to Sebastian. You and he might absolutely be
brothers.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Only,&quot; said Julian, &quot;such a thing is impossible. Mrs.
Ritherdon did not become the mother of twins, and she died within a day or so of
giving her first child birth. She could never have borne another.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;That,&quot; Spranger acquiesced, &quot;is beyond doubt.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">They prepared to separate now for the night, yet before they
did so, his host said a word to Julian. &quot;To-morrow,&quot; he told him, &quot;when I am in
the city, I will speak to one or two people who have known all about the
Desolada household ever since the place became the property of Mr. Ritherdon.
And, as perhaps you do not know, twenty-five years ago all births along the
coast, and far beyond Desolada, were registered in Belize. Now, they are thus
registered at All Pines--but it is only in later days that such has been the
case.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">And next morning, when Mr. Spranger had been gone from his
home some two or three hours, and Julian happened to be sitting alone in
Beatrix's favourite spot in the garden--she being occupied at the moment with
her household duties--a half-caste messenger from the city brought him a letter
from Mr. Spranger, or, rather, a piece of paper, on which was written--</p>
<br>

<p class="normal">&quot;Miriam Carmaux's maiden name was Gardelle and she came from New Orleans. She
married Carmaux in despair, after, it is said, being jilted by Charles Ritherdon
(who had once been in love with her). Her marriage took place about the same
time as Mr. Ritherdon's with Miss Leigh, but her husband was killed by a snake
bite a few months afterwards. Sebastian's birth was registered here by Mr.
Ritherdon, of Desolada, as taking place on the 4th of September, 1871, he being
described as the child of 'Charles Ritherdon, of Desolada, and Isobel his wife,
now dead.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Her death is also registered as taking place on the 7th of
September, 1871.&quot;</p>
<br>

<p class="normal">&quot;Sebastian's birth registered as taking place on the 4th of September, 1871!&quot;
Julian exclaimed, as the paper fell from his hand. &quot;The 4th of September, 1871!
The very day that has always been kept in England as my birthday. The very day
on which I am entered in the Admiralty books as being born in Honduras!&quot;</p>

<h5>A VISIT OF CONDOLENCE</h5>
<br>

<p class="normal">The remainder of that day was passed by
Julian in the society of Beatrix--since Mr. Spranger never came back to his
establishment--which was called &quot;Floresta&quot;--until he returned for good in the
evening; the summer noontide heat causing a drive to and from Belize for lunch
to be a journey too full of discomfort to be worth undertaking. Therefore, this
young man and woman were drawn into a companionship so close that, ere long, it
seemed to each of them that they had been acquainted for a considerable time,
while to Beatrix it began to appear that when once Lieutenant Ritherdon should
have taken his departure, the cool shady garden of her abode would prove a
vastly more desolate place than it had ever done before.</p>

<p class="normal">But, while these somewhat dreary meditations occupied her
thoughts, Julian was himself revolving in his own mind a determination to which
he had almost, if not quite, arrived at as yet--a determination that she should
be made a confidante of what engrossed now the greater part of his reflections,
i.e., the mystery which surrounded both his own birth and that of Sebastian
Ritherdon. The greater part, but not the whole of these reflections! because he
soon observed that one other form--a form far different from the handsome but
somewhat rough and saturnine figure and personality of his cousin Sebastian--was
ever present in his mind and, if not absolutely present before his actual eyes,
was never absent from his thoughts.</p>

<p class="normal">That form was the tall, graceful figure of Beatrix, surmounted
by the shapely head and beautiful features of the girl; the head crowned by
masses of fair curling hair, from beneath which those calm and clear blue eyes
gazed out through the thick and somewhat darker lashes.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I must do it,&quot; he was musing to himself now, as they sat in
the shade when the light luncheon was over, and while around them were all the
languorous accompaniments of a tropic summer day, with, also, the cloying, balmy
odours of the tropic summer atmosphere; &quot;I must do it, must take her into my
confidence, obtain her opinion as well as her father's. She can see as far as
any one, as she showed plainly enough by her manner when I told her about my
ride on that confounded horse. She might in this case perhaps, see something,
divine something of that which at present is hidden from her father and from
me.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Yet, although he had by now arrived at the determination to
impart to her all that now so agitated him, he also resolved that he would not
do so until he had taken her father's opinion on the subject.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He will not refuse, I imagine,&quot; he thought to himself. &quot;Why
should he? Especially when I represent to him that, by excluding her from the
various confidences which he and I must exchange on the matter--since he has
evidently thrown himself heart and soul into unravelling the mystery--we shall
also be dooming her to a great many hours of dulness and lack of companionship.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">But this, perhaps, savoured a little of sophistry--although
probably imperceptibly so to himself--since it must be undoubted that he also
recognised how great a lack of her companionship he was likewise dooming himself
to if she was not allowed to participate in their conversation on the all
important subject.</p>

<p class="normal">Young people are, however, sometimes more or less of sophists,
especially those who, independently of all other concerns of importance, are
experiencing a certain attractiveness that is being exercised by members of the
other sex into whose companionship they are much thrown by chance.</p>

<p class="normal">The day drew on; above them the heat--that subtle tropical
heat which has been justly compared with the atmosphere of a Turkish bath or the
engine room of a steamer--was exerting its full and irresistible power on all
and everything that was subject to its influence. Even the yellow-headed parrots
had now ceased their chattering and clacking; while Beatrix's pet monkey, whose
home was on the lower branches of a huge thatch-palm, presented a mournful
appearance of senile exhaustion, as it sat with its head bowed on its breast and
its now drawn-down, wizened features a picture of absolute but resigned despair.
And even those two human beings, each ordinarily so full of life and youth and
vigour, appeared as if--despite all laws of good breeding to the effect that
friends and acquaintances should not go to sleep in each other's presence--they
were about to yield to the atmospheric influence. Julian knew that he was
nodding, even while, as he glanced to where Beatrix's great fan had now ceased
to sway, he was still wide awake enough to suspect that his were not the only
eyes that were struggling to keep open.</p>

<p class="normal">As thus all things human and animal succumbed, or almost
succumbed, to the dead, unruffled atmosphere, and while, too, the scarlet
flowers of the flamboyants and the lilac-coloured blossoms of the oleanders
drooped, across the lawn so carefully sown, with English grass seeds every
spring and mowed and watered regularly, there fell a heavy footstep on the ears
of Beatrix and Julian--footsteps proclaimed clearly by the jingle of spurs, if
in no other way. And, a moment later, a sonorous voice was heard, expressing
regret for thus disturbing so grateful a siesta and for intruding at all.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Good afternoon, Mr. Ritherdon,&quot; Julian said, somewhat coldly,
as now Sebastian came close to them; while Beatrix--her face as calm as though
no drowsiness had come near her since the past night--greeted him with a
civility that might almost have been termed glacial, and was, undoubtedly,
distant. &quot;I suppose you have heard of my little adventure on the horse you so
kindly exchanged for my mustang?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is for that that I am here,&quot; the other answered, dropping
into a basket-chair towards which Beatrix coldly waved her hand. &quot;I cannot tell
you what my feelings, my remorse, were on hearing what had befallen you. Good
Heavens! think--just think--how I should have felt if any real, any serious
accident had befallen you! Yet, it was not my fault.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No?&quot; asked Julian. &quot;No? Did you not know the animal's
peculiarities, then?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Of course. Naturally. But, owing to the carelessness of one
of the stable hands, you were given the wrong one. I can tell you that that
fellow has had the best welting he ever had in his life and has been sent off
the estate. You won't see him there when you return to me.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No,&quot; thought Beatrix to herself, &quot;he won't. And what's more
he never would have seen him, unless he has the power of creating imaginary
people out of those who have no actual existence.&quot; While, although her lips did
not move, there was in her eyes a look--conveyed by a hasty glance towards
Julian, which told him as plainly as words could have done, what her thoughts
were.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;We had bought a new draft of horses,&quot; Sebastian went on, &quot;and
by a mistake this one--the one on which you rode--got into the wrong stall, the
stall properly belonging to the animal you ought to have had. Heavens!&quot; he
exclaimed again, &quot;when I heard that it had been found lying dead near All Pines
and that you had been attended to there--your injuries being exaggerated, I am
thankful to see--I thought I should have gone mad. You, my guest, my cousin, to
be treated thus.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It doesn't matter. Only, when I come to see you, I hope your
stableman will be more careful.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">As he spoke of returning to Desolada once more, the other
man's face lit up with a look of pleasure in the same manner that it had done on
a previous occasion. Any one regarding him now would have said that there was a
generous, hospitable host, to whom no greater satisfaction could be afforded
than to hear that his invitations were sought after and acceptable.</p>

<p class="normal">He did not deceive either of his listeners, however; not
Julian, who now had reason to suspect many things in connection with this man's
existence and possession of Desolada; nor Beatrix who, without knowing what
Julian knew, had always disliked Sebastian and, since the affair of the horse,
had formed the most unfavourable opinions concerning his good faith.</p>

<p class="normal">Probably, however, Sebastian, who also had good reasons for
doubting whether either of them was likely to believe his explanations, scarcely
expected that they should be deceived. He expressed, nevertheless, the greatest,
indeed the most vivid, satisfaction at Julian's words, and exclaimed, &quot;Ah! when
next you come to see me? That is it--what I desire. You shall be well treated, I
can assure you--the honoured relative, and all that kind of thing. Now fix the
date, Mr. Rither--cousin Julian.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">The poets and balladmongers (also the lady novelists) have
told us so frequently that there is no possibility of our ever forgetting it,
that there exists, such a thing as the language of the eyes, while, to confirm
their statements, we most of us have our own special knowledge on the subject.
And that language was now being used with considerable vehemence by Beatrix as a
means of conveying her thoughts to Julian, her sweet blue eyes signalling
clearly to him a message which she took care should be unseen by Sebastian. A
message that, if put into words, would have said: &quot;Don't go! Don't go!&quot; or,
&quot;Don't fix a date.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">But--although Julian understood perfectly that language--it
was not his cue to act upon it at the present moment. Beatrix did not know all
yet, though he was determined she should do so that very night; and, also, he
had already resolved that he would once more become an inmate of Desolada.
There, if anywhere, he believed that some proof might be found, some
circumstances discovered to throw a light upon what he believed to be a strange
reversal of the proper state of things that ought to actually exist; in short,
he was determined to accept Sebastian's invitation.</p>

<p class="normal">Purposely avoiding Beatrix's glance, therefore, while meaning
to explain his reason for doing so later on, when they should be alone, he said
now to his cousin--</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You are very good, and, of course, I shall be delighted to
come back and stay with you. As to the date, well! Mr. and Miss Spranger are so
kind and hospitable that you must let me avail myself of their welcome for a
little longer. I suppose a day need not be actually fixed just now?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Why, no, my dear fellow,&quot; Sebastian exclaimed, with that
almost boisterous cordiality which he had unfailingly evinced since they had
first met, and which might be either real or assumed. &quot;Why, no, of course not.
Indeed, there is no need to fix any date at all. There is the house and
everything in it, and there am I. Come when you like and you will find a
welcome, rough as it must needs be in this country, but at any rate sincere.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">After which there was nothing more for Julian to do than to
mutter courteous thanks for such proffered hospitality and to promise that, ere
long, he would again become a guest at Desolada.</p>

<p class="normal">They walked with Sebastian now to the stable, where his horse
was awaiting him, Beatrix proffering refreshment--to omit which courtesy to a
visitor would have been contrary to all the established, though unwritten, laws
of Honduras, as well as, one may say, of most colonies--but Sebastian, refusing
this, rode off to Belize, where he said he had business. And Julian could not
help wondering to himself if that business could possibly have any connection
with the same affairs which had brought him out from England.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You either didn't see my signals, or misunderstood them,&quot;
Beatrix said, as now they returned once more to the coolness of the garden.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Pardon me,&quot; Julian replied, &quot;I did. Only, it is
necessary--absolutely necessary, I think--that I should pay another visit to my
cousin's house. To-night your father and I are going to invite your opinion on a
matter between Sebastian and me. Then I think you will also agree that it is
necessary for me to return to Desolada.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I may do so,&quot; Beatrix said, &quot;but all the same I don't like
the idea of your being an inhabitant of that place--of your being under his roof
again.&quot;</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="div1_12" href="#div1Ref_12">CHAPTER XII.</a></h4>

<h5>THE REMINISCENCES OF A FRENCH GENTLEMAN</h5>
<br>

<p class="normal">A week later Julian was once more on his way
towards Desolada, and upon a journey which he was fully determined should either
result in satisfying him that Sebastian did not properly occupy the position
which he now held openly in the eyes of the whole colony, or should be his last
one.</p>

<p class="normal">He did not 'come to this decision without much anxious
consideration being given to the subject by himself, by Mr. Spranger, and by
Beatrix--who had been taken into the confidence of the others on the evening
following Sebastian's visit to &quot;Floresta.&quot; Nor had he arrived at the decision to
again become his cousin's guest without taking their opinions on that subject as
well.</p>

<p class="normal">And the result was--when briefly stated--that he was on his
road once more.</p>

<p class="normal">Now, as he rode along a second time on the mule (which had
been returned to its owner by a servant from Desolada), because it was at least
a safe and trusty animal although not speedy--such a qualification being,
indeed, unnecessary, in a country where few people ride swiftly because of the
heat--he was musing deeply on all that the past weeks had brought forth.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;First,&quot; he reflected, &quot;it has done one thing which was not to
be expected, and may or may not have a bearing on what I am in this place for.
It has caused me to fall over head and ears in love. Some people would say,
'That's good.' Others that it is bad, since it might distract my attention from
more serious matters. So it would be bad, for me, if she doesn't feel the same
way. I suppose I shall have courage to tell her all about it some day, but at
present I'm sure I couldn't do it. And, anyhow, we will first of all see who and
what I am. As the owner of Desolada I should be a more suitable match than as a
lieutenant of five years' seniority with a few thousand pounds in various
colonial securities.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Whereupon, since the animal had by now reached the knoll where
he had halted with his guide for luncheon upon the occasion of his former
journey along the same road, he dismounted and, drawing out of his haversack a
packet of sandwiches prepared for him by Beatrix's cook, commenced, while eating
them to reconsider all that had taken place during the past week.</p>

<p class="normal">What had taken place needs, indeed, to be set down here, since
the passage of the last few days had brought to light more than one discrepancy
in connection not only with Sebastian's first statements to Julian, but also
with his possession of all that the late Mr. Ritherdon had left him the sole
possessor of.</p>

<p class="normal">Mr. Spranger had brought home with him to dinner, on the night
following that when Beatrix had been informed of the strange variance between
the statement made by George Ritherdon in England, and the recognised position
held by Sebastian in British Honduras, an elderly gentleman who filled a
position in one of the principal schools established by the Government and in
receipt of Government aid, in the city; while, before doing so, he had suggested
to Julian that he should keep his ears open but say as little as possible. To
his daughter he had also made the same suggestion, which was, as a matter of
fact, unnecessary, since that young lady had now thrown herself heart and soul
into the unravelling of a mystery which she said was more interesting than the
plot of any novel she had read for many a long day. Also, it need scarcely be
said to which side her opinions inclined, or in which quarter her sympathies
were enlisted. Julian had wondered later, as he ate his lunch on the knoll,
whether the affection which had sprung up in his heart for this girl was ever
likely to be returned; but, had he been able to peer closely into that mystical
receptacle of conglomerate feelings--a woman's heart--his wonderment might,
perhaps, have ceased to exist.</p>

<p class="normal">With considerable skill, Mr. Spranger led the conversation at
dinner to the old residents in the colony and, at last, by more or less devious
ways, to the various personages who at one time or another had been inhabitants
of Desolada. Then, when he and his guest were, to use a hunting metaphor, in
full cry over a fine open country, he casually remarked that, among others,
Madame Carmaux had herself held a considerable place of trust in the
establishment for a great many years.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, yes,&quot; said the old gentleman, who was himself a
French-American from Florida, &quot;yes, a long time. Miriam Carmaux! Ha! Miriam
Carmaux--Miriam Gardelle as she was when she arrived here from New Orleans and
sought a place as governess. A beautiful girl then; oh! my faith, she was
beautiful.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Did she get a place as governess?&quot; Mr. Spranger asked,
filling Monsieur Lemaire's glass.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Well, you see, she did and she did not. She got lessons in
families, but no posts, no. No posts. Then, of course, she married poor Carmaux.
Oh! these snakes--ah! <i>mon Dieu</i>, that coral-snake, and the
tommy-goff--there are dreadful creatures for you! It was a tommy-goff that
killed poor Jules Carmaux.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Was it, though? And what was poor Carmaux?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Ah!&quot; said Monsieur Lemaire, shaking his head most mournfully,
&quot;he was not a solid man, not steady. Oh! no, not at all steady. Carmaux loved
pleasure too much: all kinds of pleasure. He loved cards, and--and--excuse me,
Miss Spranger--but he loved this also,&quot; while as he spoke the old gentleman
shook his head reprovingly at the claret jugs. &quot;Also he loved sport--shooting
the curassow, hunting the raccoon and the jaguar--ah! he did not love work. Oh,
no! Work and he were never the best of friends. Then the tommy-goff killed him
in the woods.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Perhaps,&quot; remarked Beatrix with one of her bright smiles, &quot;as
a punishment for his not loving work.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;But,&quot; said Mr. Spranger, &quot;he must have been a poor husband
for that young lady, Mademoiselle Gardelle, as she was then. If he would not
work, how did he support a wife?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Ah!&quot; said Monsieur Lemaire with a very emphatic shake of his
head now, so that Beatrix wondered he did not get quite warm over the exertion,
&quot;Ah! they did say that he thought she might earn the money to support him.&quot; And
still he wagged his head.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I wonder,&quot; exclaimed Julian, who had been listening to all
this with considerable interest, &quot;that she should have married him. He seems to
have been a useless sort of man.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Ah! Ah! There were reasons, very sad reasons. You see, she
had been in love with another man. Ah! <i>mon Dieu</i>, these love affairs.
Another man, Mr. Ritherdon, was supposed to have been the object of her
affections.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Dear! dear,&quot; said Mr. Spranger.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes. Only--&quot; and now Monsieur Lemaire made a sort of
apologetic, old-court-life-in-France style of bow to Beatrix, as though
beseeching pardon for the errors of his own sex--sinking his voice, too, to a
kind of pleading one, as well as one reprobating the late Mr. Ritherdon's
conduct--&quot;only he jilted her.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Good gracious!&quot; exclaimed the girl, feeling it necessary to
say something in return for the old Frenchman's politeness, while, as a matter
of fact, she had heard the story from her father only a night or so before.
&quot;Good gracious!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Ah! yes. Ah! yes,&quot; Lemaire continued. &quot;It was so indeed.
Indeed it was. Then, they do say----&quot; And now he sank his voice so much that he
might have been reciting the history of some most awful and soul-stirring Greek
tragedy, &quot;they do say that in her rage and despair she flung herself away on
Carmaux. But the tommy-goff killed him after he trod on it in the woods--and,
so, she was free.&quot; Then his voice rose crescendo, as though the mention of the
tragedy being concluded, a lighter tone was permissible.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Take some more claret,&quot; said Mr. Spranger; &quot;help yourself.&quot;
While as the old gentleman did so, he continued--</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;But how in such circumstances did she become a resident in
Mr. Ritherdon's house? One would have thought that was the last place she would
be found in next.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Ah!&quot; said Monsieur Lemaire, &quot;then the woman's heart, the
heart of all good women&quot;--and he bowed solemnly now to Beatrix--&quot;exerted its
sway. She was bereft, even the little girl, the poor little daughter that had
been born to her after Carmaux's death--when the tommy-goff killed him--was dead
and buried----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;So she had had a daughter?&quot; said Mr. Spranger.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Poor woman, yes. But what--what was I saying. The good
woman's heart prompted her, and, smothering her own griefs, forgetting her own
wrongs, knowing the stupendous misery which had fallen on the man who had jilted
her through the loss of his wife, she went to him and offered to look after the
poor little motherless Sebastian; to be a guide and nurse to it. Ah! a noble
woman was Miriam Carmaux, a woman who buried her own griefs in assuaging those
of others.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;She went to Desolada,&quot; Julian said, &quot;after Mrs. Ritherdon's
death? She did that? After Mrs. Ritherdon's death?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;<i>Si</i>. After her death. Soon. Very soon. As soon as her
own sorrows, her own loss, were more or less softened.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">That night, when Monsieur Lemaire had been driven back into
the city in Mr. Spranger's buggy, the latter gentleman, his daughter and Julian,
sat out on the lawn, inhaling the cool breeze which comes up from the sea at
sunset as well as watching the fireflies dancing. All were quite silent now, for
all were occupied with their own thoughts: Julian in reflecting on what Monsieur
Lemaire had said; Beatrix in wondering whether George Ritherdon's dying
disclosures could possibly have been true; Mr. Spranger in feeling positive that
they were false. Everything, he told himself, or almost everything, pointed to
such being the case. The registration of Sebastian's birth by the late Mr.
Ritherdon; the acknowledgment of the young man during all the dead man's
remaining years as his heir: the knowledge which countless people possessed in
the colony of Sebastian's whole life having been passed at Desolada! And against
this, what set-off was there?</p>

<p class="normal">Only the falsehood--for such it must have been--told by
Sebastian to the effect that Miriam Carmaux was his mother's relative, which,
since she was a French creole, was impossible. Nothing much more than that;
nothing tangible.</p>

<p class="normal">As for the slip made by him to Julian, the words, &quot;My mother
ca--I mean my mother always wanted to go there and see it,&quot; (New Orleans being
the place referred to) well, there was nothing in that. It was a slip any one
might easily have made. And no living soul in British Honduras had ever heard a
whisper of any stolen child. Surely that was enough to settle all doubt.</p>

<p class="normal">Then, breaking in upon the silence around, he and his daughter
heard Julian saying: &quot;If Monsieur Lemaire's facts are accurate, Sebastian made
another misstatement to me. He said that Madame Carmaux had been at Desolada for
many years, <i>even before his mother died</i>. That could not have been so.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And,&quot; said Beatrix, emerging now from the silence which she
had preserved so long, &quot;it was perhaps with reference to that subject that he
had uttered the words which you overheard, to the effect that you must know
something, but that knowledge was not always proof.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;All the same,&quot; said Mr. Spranger now, &quot;it is a blank wall, a
wall against which you will push in vain, I fear. Honestly, I see no outlet.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Nor I,&quot; answered Julian, &quot;yet all the same I mean to try and
find one. At present I am groping in the dark; perhaps the light will come some
day.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I cannot believe it,&quot; Mr. Spranger said, &quot;much as I might
like to do so. If--if Charles Ritherdon's child had been stolen from its
father's house how could it be that, in so small a place as this, the thing
would never have been heard of? And if it was stolen, if you were stolen, how
could another, a substitute, take your place?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Heaven only knows,&quot; Julian replied. &quot;It is to find out this
that I am going back to Desolada,&quot; while as he spoke, he saw again on Beatrix's
face the look of dissent to that proposed journey which, a day or two before,
she had signalled to him through her eyes.</p>

<p class="normal">So--determinate, resolved to fathom the mystery, if mystery
there were; refusing, too, to believe that George Ritherdon's story could have
been one huge fabrication, one hideous falsehood from beginning to end, and that
a fabrication, a falsehood, which must ere long be disproved, directly it was
challenged--he did set out and was by now drawing near the end of his journey.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Only,&quot; said Beatrix to him on the morning of his departure,
&quot;I do so wish you would let me persuade you not to go. I dread----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Oh!&quot; she said, raising her hands to her hair with a
bewildered movement--a movement that perhaps expressed regret as to the
destination for which he was about to depart. &quot;I do not know. Yet--still--I
fear. Sebastian Ritherdon is cruel;--fierce--if--if--he thought you were about
to cross his path--if--he knows anything that you do not know, then I dread what
the end may be. And, I shall think always of that half-caste girl--peering
in--glaring into your room, with perhaps, if she is a creature, a tool of his,
murder in her heart.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Fear nothing, I beseech you,&quot; he said deeply moved at her
sympathy. &quot;I can be very firm--very resolute--when occasion needs. Fear
nothing.&quot;</p>

<h5>A CHANGE OF APARTMENTS</h5>
<br>

<p class="normal">A boisterous welcome from Sebastian, a
cordial grasp of the hand, accompanied by a smile from the dark eyes of Madame
Carmaux (which latter would have appeared more sincere to Julian had the corners
of the mouth been less drawn down and the eyelids closed a little less, while
the eyes behind those lids glittering with a light that seemed to him
unnatural), did not, to use a metaphor, throw any dust in his own eyes.</p>

<p class="normal">For long reflection on everything that had occurred since
first George Ritherdon had made his statement in the Surrey home until now, when
Julian stood once more in the house in which he believed himself to have been
born, had only served to produce in his mind one conviction--the firm conviction
that George Ritherdon was his uncle and had spoken the truth; that Sebastian
was--in spite of all evidence seeming to point in a totally different
direction--occupying a position which was not rightly his. A belief that, before
long, he was resolved at all hazards to himself to justify and disprove once and
for all.</p>

<p class="normal">The hilarious welcome on the part of Sebastian did not deceive
him, therefore; the greeting of Madame Carmaux was, he felt, insincere. And
feeling thus he knew that in the latter was one against whom he would have to be
doubly on his guard.</p>

<p class="normal">And on his guard, against both the man and the woman, he
commenced to be from the moment when he once more entered the precincts of
Desolada.</p>

<p class="normal">That night at dinner, which was here called supper, but which
only varied from the former meal in name, he observed a most palpable desire on
the part of both his hosts to extract from him all that he had done while
staying with the Sprangers--as well as an even stronger desire to discover into
what society he might have been introduced, or what acquaintances he might
happen to have made.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I made one acquaintance,&quot; he replied to Madame Carmaux, who
was by far the most pertinacious in her inquiries, &quot;the hearing about whom may
interest you considerably. A gentleman who knew you long ago.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Indeed!&quot; she said, &quot;and who might that be?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">She asked the question lightly, almost indifferently,
yet--unless the flicker of the lamp in the middle of the table was playing
tricks with his vision--there came suddenly a look of nervousness, of
apprehension, upon her face. A look controlled yet not altogether to be subdued.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It was Monsieur Lemaire,&quot; he replied, &quot;the professor of
modern languages at the Victoria College. He said he knew you very well once,
before your marriage.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes,&quot; she replied, &quot;he did,&quot; and now he saw that, whatever
nervousness she might be experiencing, she was exerting a strong power of
suppression of any visible outward sign of her feelings. &quot;Monsieur Lemaire was
very good to me. He enabled me to find employment as a teacher in various
houses. What did he tell you besides?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He mentioned the sad ending to your marriage. Also the death
of your little---- Excuse me,&quot; he broke off, &quot;but you have upset your glass.
Allow me,&quot; and from where he sat he bent forward, and with his napkin sopped up
the spilt water which had been in that glass.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It was very clumsy,&quot; she muttered. &quot;My loose sleeves are
always knocking things over. Thank you. But what was it you said he mentioned?
The death of my----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Little daughter,&quot; Julian replied softly, feeling sorry--and
indeed, annoyed with himself--at what he now considered a lack of delicacy and
consideration. A lack of feeling, because he thought it very possible that, even
after a long lapse of time, this poor widowed woman might still lament bitterly
the death of her little child.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Ah! yes,&quot; she said, though why now her face should brighten
considerably he did not understand. &quot;Ah! yes. Poor little thing, it did not live
long, only a very little while. Poor little baby!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Looking still under the lamp and feeling still a little
disconcerted at the reflection that he had quite unintentionally recalled
unhappy recollections to Madame Carmaux, he saw that Sebastian was also
regarding her with a strange, almost bewildered look in his eyes. What that look
meant, Julian was not sufficiently a judge of expression to fathom; yet, had he
been compelled there and then to describe what feeling that glance most
suggested to him, he would probably have termed it one of surprise.</p>

<p class="normal">Surprise, perhaps, that Madame Carmaux should have been so
emotional as to exhibit such tenderness at the recollection being brought to her
mind of her little infant daughter, dead twenty-five years ago and almost at the
hour of its birth.</p>

<p class="normal">No more was said, however, on the subject and an adjournment
was made directly the meal was over to the veranda, that place on which in
British Honduras almost all people pass the hours of the evening; none staying
indoors more than is absolutely necessary. And here their conversation became of
the most ordinary kind for some time, its commonplace nature only being varied
occasionally by divers questions put to Julian by both Sebastian and Madame
Carmaux as to what George Ritherdon's existence had been since he quitted
Honduras to return to England.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It was a quiet enough one,&quot; replied Julian, carefully
weighing every word he uttered and forcing himself to be on his guard over every
sentence. &quot;Quiet enough. He took to England some capital from this part of the
world, as I have always understood, and he was enabled to make a sufficient
living by the use of it to provide for us both. He was never rich, yet since his
desires were not inordinate, we did well enough. At any rate, he was able to
place me in the only calling I was particularly desirous of following, without
depriving himself of anything.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And he left money behind?&quot; Madame Carmaux asked, while, even
as she did so, Julian could not but observe that her manner was listless and
absent, as well as to perceive that she only threw in a remark now and again
with a view of appearing to be interested in the conversation.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes,&quot; he replied, &quot;he left money behind him. Not much; some
few thousand pounds fairly well invested. Enough, anyhow, for a sailor who, at
the worst, can live on his pay.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;All the same,&quot; Sebastian said, &quot;a few thousand pounds is a
mighty good thing to have handy. I wish I had a few.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You!&quot; exclaimed Julian, looking at him in surprise. &quot;Why! I
should have thought you had any amount. This is a big property, even for the
colonies, and Mr. Ritherdon--your father--has left the reputation behind him in
Belize of being one of the richest planters in the place.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Ay,&quot; said Sebastian, &quot;rich in produce, stores, cattle, and so
forth, but no money. No ready money. Not sufficient to work a large place like
this. Why, look here, Julian, as a matter of fact, you and I are each other's
heirs, yet I expect I'd sooner come in for your few thousands than you would for
Desolada. One can do a lot with a few thousands. I wish I had some.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Didn't your father leave any ready money, then?&quot; Julian
asked.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Oh, yes! He did. But it's all sunk in the place already.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Such a conversation as this would, in ordinary circumstances,
have been one of no importance and certainly not worth recording, had it
not--short as it was--furnished Julian with some further food for reflections.
And among other shapes which those reflections took, one was that he did not
believe that all the money which Mr. Ritherdon was stated to have died possessed
of had been sunk in the estate. He, the late Mr. Ritherdon, had been able to put
by money out of the products of that estate--it scarcely stood to reason,
therefore, that his successor would have instantly invested all that money in
it. Wherefore Julian at once came to the conclusion that if it was really
gone--vanished--it had done so in Sebastian's gambling transactions.</p>

<p class="normal">Then, as to their being each other's heirs! Well, that view
had never occurred to him--certainly it had never occurred to him that by any
chance Sebastian could be his heir. Yet, if Sebastian was in truth Charles
Ritherdon's son and he, Julian, was absolutely George Ritherdon's son, such was
the case. And, if anything should happen to him while staying here at Desolada,
where he had announced himself plainly as the son of George Ritherdon, he could
scarcely doubt that Sebastian would put in a claim as that heir. If anything
should happen to him!</p>

<p class="normal">Well! it might! One could never tell. It might! Especially as,
when Sebastian had uttered those words, he had seen a flash from Madame
Carmaux's eyes and had observed a light spring into them which told plainly
enough that she had never regarded matters in that aspect before; that this new
view of the state of things had startled her.</p>

<p class="normal">If anything should happen to him! Well, to prevent anything
doing so he must be doubly careful of himself. That was all.</p>

<p class="normal">The evening--like most evenings spent in the tropics and away
from the garish amusements and gaieties of tropical towns--was passed more or
less monotonously, it being got through by scraps of conversation, by two or
three cooling drinks being partaken of by Julian and Sebastian, and by Madame
Carmaux in falling asleep in her chair. Though, Julian thought, her slumbers
could neither have been very sound nor refreshing, seeing that, whenever he
chanced to turn his eyes towards her, he observed how hers were open and fixed
on him, though shut immediately that she perceived he had noticed that they were
unclosed.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Come,&quot; exclaimed Sebastian now, springing from out of his
chair with as much alacrity as is ever testified in the tropics, while as he did
so Madame Carmaux became wide-awake in the most perfect manner. &quot;Come, this
won't do. Early to bed you know--and all the rest of it. We practise that good
old motto here.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I thought you practised stopping up rather late when I was
here last,&quot; Julian remarked quietly. &quot;As I told you, I heard your voices and saw
you sitting in the balcony long after I had turned in.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;But to-night we must be off to bed early,&quot; Sebastian replied.
&quot;I have to start for Belize to-morrow in good time, as I remarked to you at
supper, and you are going to take a gun and try for some shooting in the
Cockscomb mountains. Early to bed, my boy, early, and, also, an early
breakfast.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">After which Julian and Madame Carmaux made their adieux to
each other for the night, while Sebastian, as he had done before, escorted his
cousin up the vast stairs to his room. This room was, however, a different one
from that occupied previously by Julian, it being on the other side of the house
and looking towards those Cockscomb mountains which, gun in hand, he was to
explore on the morrow.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is a better room,&quot; said Sebastian, &quot;than the other, as you
see; although not so large. And the sun will not bother you here in the morning,
nor will our chatter on the balcony beneath or inside the room do so either.
Good night, sleep well. To-morrow, breakfast at six.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Good-night,&quot; replied Julian as he entered the room, and,
after Sebastian was out of earshot (as he calculated), turned the key in the
lock. Then, as he sat himself down in his chair, after again producing his
revolver and placing it by his side, he thought to himself:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes! he spoke truly. Their conversation below will not
disturb me, nor will there be any chance of my overhearing it. All right,
Sebastian, you understand the old proverb about one for me and two for yourself.
But you have for gotten a little fact, namely, that a sailor can move about
almost as lightly as a cat when he chooses, and, if I think you and your
respected housekeeper have anything to say that it will be worth my while to
hear--why, I shall be a cat for the time being.&quot;</p>

<h4><a name="div1_14" href="#div1Ref_14">CHAPTER XIV.</a></h4>

<h5>&quot;THIS LAND IS FULL OF SNAKES.&quot;</h5>
<br>

<p class="normal">The truth was, as the reader is by now very
well aware, that Julian no more believed in either Sebastian's lawful possession
of Desolada or in his being the son of Charles Ritherdon, than he believed that
George Ritherdon had concocted the whole of that story which he narrated ere his
death. &quot;For,&quot; said the young man to himself, &quot;if it were true, his manner and
her manner--that of the superb Madame Carmaux--would not be what they are.
'Think it out,' our old naval instructor in the Brit, used to say, 'analyze,
compare, exercise the few brains Heaven has mercifully given you.' Well, I
will--or, rather, I have.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">And he had done so. He had thought it all over and over
again--Sebastian's manner, Madame Carmaux's manner, Sebastian's slight
inaccuracies of statement, Madame Carmaux's pretence of being asleep when she
was awake, and her strange side-glances at him when she thought he was not
observing her.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I played <i>Hamlet</i> once at an amateur show in the
Leviathan,&quot; he mused. &quot;It was an awful performance, and, if it had been for more
than one act, I should undoubtedly have been hissed out of the ship. All the
same it taught me something. What was it the poor chap said? 'I'll take the
ghost's word for a thousand pounds.' Well, I'll take my uncle's word--for uncle
he was and he was telling the truth--for a thousand pounds, too. Only, how to
prove it? That is the question--which, by-the-bye, Hamlet also remarked.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">That was indeed the question. How to prove it!</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;That fellow is no more Charles Ritherdon's son than I'm a
soldier,&quot; he went on, &quot;and I <i>am</i> the son. That I'm sure of! Everything,
every fresh look on their faces, every word they say, convinces me only the more
certainly. Even this shifting of the room I am to occupy: why, Lord bless me!
does he think I'm a fool? Yet, all the same, I don't see how it is to be proved.
Confound them! Some one played a trick on Charles Ritherdon after George had
stolen me--for steal me he did--some trick or other. And she, this Madame
Carmaux was in it. Only why--why--<i>why?</i>&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He clenched his hands in front of his forehead, as he recalled now Mr.
Spranger's words: &quot;It is a blank wall against which you will push in vain.&quot;
Almost, indeed, he began to fear that such was the case; that never would he
throw down that wall which rose an adamantine object between him and his belief.
Yet, even as he did so, he recollected that he was an Englishman and a sailor;
that, consequently, he must be resolved not to be beaten. Only, how was it to be
accomplished; how was the defeat to be avoided?</p>

<p class="normal">As he arrived at this determination he heard, outside on the
veranda, a sound which he had heard more than once on his first visit, and when
he slept on the other side of the mansion. A sound, light, stealthy--such a one
as if some soft-footed creature, a cat, perhaps, was creeping gently in the
night along the balcony. Creeping nearer to his window in front of which, as had
been the case before, the Venetian blind was lowered.</p>

<p class="normal">Then he resolved that, this time, his strange visitant should
know that he had discovered the spying to which he was again to be subjected.</p>

<p class="normal">In a moment he feigned sleep as he sat by the table on which
stood the lamp--casting out a considerable volume of light--while, as he did so,
he let his outstretched hands and fingers cover the revolver.</p>

<p class="normal">And still the weird, soft scraping of those catlike feet came
nearer; he knew that his ghost-like visitor was close to the open window. He
heard also, though it was the faintest click in the world, the slat or lath
turning the least little bit, he knew that now those eyes that had gleamed into
the other and darkened room were gleaming in at him in this one.</p>

<p class="normal">Then, suddenly, he opened his own eyes as wide as he could,
while with his outstretched hand he now raised the revolver and pointed it at
the little dusky figure that he could see was holding the slat back, while he
said in a voice, low but perfectly clear in the silence of the night:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Don't move. Stop where you are--there--outside that blind
till I come to you. If you do move I will scatter your brains on the floor of
the veranda!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">And as he rose and went towards the persianas he could see
that his instructions were--through fear--obeyed. The eyes, now white, horrible,
almost chalky in their glare of fright, instead of being dusky as he had once
seen them, stared with a hideous expression of terror into the room. Also, the
brown finger which was crooked over the blind-slat trembled.</p>

<p class="normal">He pulled the persianas up with his left hand, still keeping
his right hand extended with the revolver in it (of course only with the
intention of frightening the girl into making no attempt to fly); then, when he
had fastened the pulley he took her unceremoniously by the upper part of the arm
and led her into the room.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Now, Mademoiselle Zara, as I understand your name to be,
kindly give me an explanation of why, whenever I am in my room in this house,
you honour me with these attentions. My manly beauty can be observed at any time
in the daylight much better than at night, and----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Don't tell him,&quot; the girl whispered, and he felt as he still
held her arm that she was trembling, while, also, he saw that she was deathly
pale, her usual coffee-and-milk complexion being more of the latter than the
former now. &quot;Oh, don't tell him!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Don't tell whom?&quot; he asked astonished. Astonished at first,
since he had deemed her an emissary of his host, sent to pry in on him for some
reason best known to both of them. Then, he reflected, this was only some ruse
hatched in her scheming, half-Indian brain, whereby to escape from his clutches;
upon which he said:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Now, look here. No lies. What do you come peeping and prying
in on me for in the middle of the night. Perhaps you're not aware that I saw you
do so the last time I was here.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I came to see,&quot; she said inconsequently, &quot;if you were
comfortable; I am a servant----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">But now Julian laughed so loudly at this ridiculous statement
that the girl in hasty terror--and if it was assumed, she must be a good
actress, he thought--put up her hand as though she intended to clap it over his
mouth.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Oh!&quot; she whispered, &quot;don't! Don't! He will hear you--or <i>
she</i>
will----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Well, what if they do! I suppose they know you are here just
as much as I do. Come,&quot; he continued, &quot;come, don't look so frightened, I'm not
going to shoot you or harm you in any way. Though, mind you, my dark beauty, you
might have got shot if you had timed your visit at a later hour and startled me
out of a heavy slumber, or if I had seen those eyes looking in on me in the dead
of night However, out with the explanation. Quick.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">For a moment the girl paused as though thinking deeply, then
she looked up at him with all the deep tropical glow once more in her sombre
eyes, and said:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I won't tell you. No. But----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;But what?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I--will you believe what I say?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Perhaps. That depends. I might, if it sounded likely.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Listen, then. I don't come here to do you any harm. My visits
won't hurt you. Only--only--this is a dangerous house in more ways than one. It
is a very old one--strange things happen sometimes in it. How,&quot; she said, and
now her voice which had been sunk to a whisper became even lower, &quot;how would you
like to die in it?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Perhaps the slow mysterious tones of that voice--the something
weird and wizard in the elf-like appearance of this dusky girl who was, in
truth, beautiful with that beauty often found in the half-caste Indian--was what
caused Julian to feel a sort of creepiness to come over him in spite of the
warm, bath-like temperature of the night.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Neither in this house nor elsewhere, just at present,&quot; he
remarked, steadying his nerves. &quot;But,&quot; he continued, &quot;I don't suppose there is
much likelihood of that. Who is going to cause me to die?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">For answer the girl cast those marvellous orbs of hers all
around the room, taking, meanwhile, as she did so, the mosquito curtains in her
hands and shaking them with a swish away from the floor on which they drooped in
festoons; she looking also behind the bedposts and in other places.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No one--to-night,&quot; she said, &quot;but--but--if I may not come
here again, if you will not let me, then do this always. And--perhaps--some
night you will know.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">After which she moved off towards the window, her lithe,
graceful figure seeming to glide without the assistance of any movement from her
feet towards the open space; and made as though she meant to retire. Yet, as she
stood within the framework of that window, she turned and looked back at him,
her finger slightly raised as though impressing silence.</p>

<p class="normal">Then she stepped outside on to the boards of the veranda and
peered over the front of it down towards the garden from which, now, there rose
the countless perfumes exhaled by the Caribbean wealth of flowers. Also, she
crept along to either side of the window, glancing to right and left of her
until, at that moment, borne on the soft night breeze, there came from the front
of the house, a harsh, strident, and contemptuous laugh--the laugh of Sebastian
Ritherdon. When, seemingly reassured by this, she returned again towards the
open window and said:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You go to-morrow to the Cockscomb mountains shooting. Yet,
when there, be careful. Danger is there, too. This land is full of snakes, the
coral snake--which kills instantly, even like the <i>fer de lance</i>
of the islands, the rattlesnake, the tamagusa, or, as you English say, the
'tommy-goff.' One killed him--her husband,&quot; and she pointed down to where Madame
Carmaux might be supposed to be sitting at this moment, while as she did so he
saw in her eyes a look so startling--since they blazed with fire--that he stared
amazed. Was she, this half-savage girl, gloating over the horrid death of a man
which must have taken place ere she was born? Or--or--what?</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;In all the land,&quot; she went on, &quot;there are snakes. Those I
tell you of--and--others. You understand? And others.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I almost understand,&quot; Julian muttered hoarsely--though he
knew not why. &quot;<i>And others</i>. Is that--? ah! yes--I do understand. Yet tell
me further, tell----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">But she was gone; the window frame was empty of the dark
shadowy figure it had enshrouded. Gone, as he saw when he stepped out on to the
balcony and observed a sombre form stealing along betwixt the bright gleams of
the low-lying stars and himself.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Why does she warn me thus,&quot; he muttered to himself as now he
began to undress slowly, &quot;why? She is that man's servant--almost, as servants go
here, his slave. Why warn me--she whom I deemed his creature--she who does his
dirty work as croupier at a gambling hell? And she gloated over Carmaux's death
in days of long ago--why that also? Does she hate this woman who governs here as
mistress of the house?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">With some degree of horror on him now, with some sort of
mystic terror creeping over him at unknown and spectrelike dangers that might be
surrounding his existence, he turned down the light serape stretched over the
bed for coverlet, and threw back the upper sheet Then he started away with a
hoarse exclamation at what he saw.</p>

<p class="normal">For, lying coiled up in the middle of the bed, yet with a
hideous flat head raised and vibrating, while from out that head gleamed a pair
of threatening and scintillating emerald eyes, was a small, red coral-coloured
snake--a snake that next unwound itself slowly with horribly lithe and sinuous
movements which caused Julian to turn cold, warm as the night was.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;So,&quot; he whispered to himself, as now he seized a rifle that
he had brought out from England with him, and, after beating the reptile on to
the floor, used the stock as a bat and sent the thing flying out of the window;
&quot;this is what she was looking for, what she expected to find. But where are the
others? The other snakes she hinted at? I think I can guess.&quot;</p>

<h4><a name="div1_15" href="#div1Ref_15">CHAPTER XV.</a></h4>

<h5>RECOLLECTIONS OF SEBASTIAN'S BIRTH</h5>
<br>

<p class="normal">It is forty miles inland to where the
Cockscomb mountains rear their appropriately named crests, but not half that
distance to where obliquely from north to south there run spurs and ridges
which, though they do not rise to the four thousand feet that is attained by the
highest peak or summit of the range, are still lofty mountains. Here, amidst
these spurs and ridges, which dominate and break up what is otherwise a country,
or lowland, almost as flat as Holland (and which until a few years ago was
marked on the maps as &quot;unexplored country&quot;), Nature presents a different aspect
from elsewhere in the colony. The country becomes wild and rugged; the copses of
mangroves are superseded by woods and forests of prickly bamboos and umbrageous
figs; vast clumps of palms of all denominations cluster together, forming in
their turn other little woods, while rivers, whose sources are drawn from the
great lagoons inland, roll swiftly towards the sea.</p>

<p class="normal">Here, upon the bank of one of those lagoons, Julian sat next
day beneath the shadow of a clump of locust-trees, in which were intermingled
other trees of salm-wood, braziletto, and turtle-bone, as well as many others
almost unknown of and unheard of by Europeans, with at his feet a fowling-piece,
while held across his knees was a safety repeating rifle. This was the rifle
with which he had overnight beaten out on to the veranda (where this morning he
had left it dead and crushed) the coral snake, and which he had provided himself
with ere he left England in case opportunities for sport should arise. The gun,
an old-fashioned thing lent him by Sebastian, he had not used against any of the
feathered inhabitants of the woods, although many opportunities had arisen of
shooting partridges, wild pigeons, whistling ducks, quails, and others. Had not
used it because, remembering one or two other incidents, such as that of the
horse and that of the coral-snake (which might have crept into his bed for extra
warmth, as such reptiles will do even in the hottest climates, but on the other
hand might have reached that spot by different means), and because since also he
was now full of undefined suspicion, he thought it very likely that if used it
would burst in his hands.</p>

<p class="normal">He was not alone, as by his side, there sat now a man whose
features, as well as his spare, supple frame, bespoke him one of that tribe of
half-breeds, namely, Spanish and Carib Indian, which furnishes so large a
proportion of the labourers to the whole of Central America. He was an elderly
man, this--a man nearer sixty than fifty, with snow-white hair; yet any one who
should have regarded him from behind, or watched his easy strides from a
distance, or his method of mounting an incline, might well have been excused for
considering him to be about thirty-five.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What did Mr. Ritherdon strike you for this morning?&quot; Julian
asked now, while, as he spoke he raised his rifle off his knee, and, with it
ready to be brought to the shoulder, sat watching a number of ripples which
appeared a hundred and fifty yards away in the lagoon.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Because he is a cruel man,&quot; his companion, who was at the
present time his guide, replied; &quot;because, too, everything makes him angry
now--even so small a thing as my having buckled his saddle-girth too loose. A
cruel man and getting worse. Always angry now.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Why?&quot; asked Julian, raising the rifle and aiming it at this
moment towards a conical grey-looking object that appeared above the ripples on
the lagoon--an object that was, in absolute fact, the snout of an alligator.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Because--don't fire yet, senor; he's coming nearer--because,
oh! because things go very bad with him, they say. He lose much money
and--and--pretty Missy Sprangy don't love him.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Does he love her?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;They say. Say, too, Massa Sprangy much money. Seabastiano
wants money as well as pretty missy. Never get it, though. Perhaps, too, he not
live get much more.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What do you mean?&quot; asked Julian, lowering the rifle as the
huge reptile in the lagoon now drew its head under water; while he looked also
at the man with stern, inquiring eyes. &quot;What do you mean?&quot; Though inwardly he
said to himself: &quot;This is a new phase in these mysterious surroundings. My life
doesn't seem just now one that the insurance companies would be very glad to get
hold of, while also my beloved cousin's doesn't appear to be a very good one.
Lively place, this!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He very much hated,&quot; the half-breed answered. &quot;Very cruel.
Some day tommy-goffy give him a nice bite, or half-breed gentleman put a knife
in his liver.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;The snakes don't hate him, do they? He can't be cruel to
them.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">The other gave a laugh at this; it was indeed a laugh which
was something between the bleating of a sheep and the (so-called) terrible
war-whoop of a North-American Indian; then he replied: &quot;Easy enough make
tommy-goffy hate him. Take tommy into room where a man sleeps, wrapped up in a
serape with his head out, then put him mouth to man's arm. Tommy do the rest.
Gentleman want no breakfast.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;This <i>is</i> a nice country!&quot; Julian thought. &quot;I'm blessed
if some of these chaps couldn't give the natives in India, or the dear old
Chinese, a tip or two.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">While as he so reflected, he also thought: &quot;Easy enough, too,
to put tommy-goff into a man's bed. Then that man wouldn't want any breakfast
either. It's rather a good job that I found myself with an appetite this
morning.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Here he comes,&quot; the man, whose name was Paz, exclaimed, now
suddenly referring to the alligator. &quot;Hit him in the eye if you can, señor, or
mouth. If he gets on shore we shall have to run.&quot; While, as he spoke, from out
of the lagoon there rose the head of an enormous alligator, which seemed to have
touched bottom since it was waddling ashore.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I shall never hit him in the eye,&quot; Julian said, taking
deliberate aim, however. &quot;Gather up the traps, Paz, and get further away. I'll
have a shot at him; and, then if he comes on land, I'll have another. Here
goes.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">But now, even as he prepared to fire, the beast gave him a
chance, since, either from wishing to draw breath or from excitement at seeing a
probable meal, it suddenly began opening and shutting its vast jaws as it came
along, so that the hideous rows of yellow teeth, and the whity-pink roof of its
mouth were plainly visible. And, at that moment, from the repeating rifle rang
out a report, while, after the smoke had drifted away, it was easy to perceive
that the monster had received a deadly wound. It was now spread-eagled out upon
the rim of the lagoon's bank, its short, squat legs endeavouring to grip the
sand, its eyes rolled up in its head and a stream of blood pouring from its open
mouth.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Though,&quot; said Julian, as now he approached close to the
creature, and, taking steady aim, delivered another bullet into its eye which
instantly gave it the <i>coup de grace</i>; &quot;though I don't know why I should
have killed the poor beast either. It couldn't have done me any harm.&quot; Then he
thought, &quot;I might as well have reserved the fire for something that threatened
danger to me.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He had had enough sport for the day by now, having done that
which every visitor to Central America is told he ought to do, namely, kill a
jaguar and an alligator; wherefore, bidding Paz go on with the skinning of the
former (which the man had already began earlier) since the spotted coat of this
creature is worth preserving, he took a last look at the dead reptile lying half
in and half out of the lagoon, and then made preparations for their return to
Desolada. These preparations consisted of readjusting the saddle on the mustang,
which he was still the temporary proprietor of, and in also saddling Paz's mule
for him.</p>

<p class="normal">Then, when the operation of skinning was finished, they took
their way back towards the coast.</p>

<p class="normal">Among other questions which Julian had asked this man during
the morning with reference to the owner of the above abode, was one as to how
long he had been present on the estate--a question which had remained unanswered
owing to the killing of the jaguar having occurred ere it could be answered. But
now--now that they were riding easily forward, the skin of the creature hanging
like a horse-cloth over the tail of the half-breed's mule, he returned to it.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;How long did you say you had known Mr. Ritherdon and his
household?&quot; he asked, referring of course to the late owner of the property to
the borders of which they were now approaching.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Didn't say anything,&quot; Paz replied, &quot;because then we killed
him,&quot; and he touched the fast drying skin of the dead animal. &quot;But I know
Desolada for over thirty years. Before Massa Ritherdon come.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Then you've known the present Mr. Ritherdon all his
life--since the day he was born.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes. Yes. Oh, yes. Since that day. Always remember that. Same
day my poor old mother die. She Carib from Tortola.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Did you know his--mother--too; the lady who had been Miss
Leigh?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes. Yes. Oh, yes. I know her. I remember she beautiful young
girl--English missy. With the blue eye and the skin like the peach and the hair
like the wheat. Oh, yes. I remember her. Very beautiful.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Blue eyes, skin like a peach, hair like the wheat,&quot; thought
Julian to himself; &quot;his supposed mother, my own mother as before Heaven I
believe. Yet he, Sebastian, speaks of this woman Carmaux, this woman of French
origin hailing from New Orleans, as a near relative of hers. Bah! it is
impossible.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Also I remember,&quot; Paz went on, &quot;when--when--his brother--the
man who Sebastian tell us the other day was your father--love her too. And she
love him. Only old man Leigh he say that no good. Old man ruin very much. They
say constabulary and old man English Chief Justice very likely to arrest him.
Then Missy Leigh save her father and marry Massa Ritherdon when Massa George's
back turned.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Julian nodded as he heard all this--nodded as though
confirming Paz's story. Though, in fact, it was Paz's story which confirmed that
which the dead man in England had told him.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You knew her and her father, Mr. Leigh?&quot; he asked now.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Know him! Know him! I worked for him at the Essex
hacienda----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Essex hacienda!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, he gave it that name because he love it. 'All my family,
Paz,' he say to me one day when I was painting the name on waggon--'all my
family come from Essex many, many long years. All born there--grandmother,
father, mother, myself, and daughter Isobel, Paz. All; every one. Oh! Paz,' he
say to me, 'England always been good enough for us till my turn come. Then I
very bad young man--very dis--dis--dis--something he say. Now, he say, I have to
be the first exile of family, I and poor little Isobel. No Leigh ever have to
live abroad before!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Did he say all that, Paz? Is this the truth?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Truff, sir! Sir, my father Spanish gentleman, my mother Carib
lady. Very fine lady.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;All right. I beg your pardon. Never mind, I did not mean
that. And so you remember when this Mr. Ritherdon was born, eh? Did the old
gentleman seem pleased?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He very pleased about the son--very sad about the poor wife.
He weep much, oh! many weeps. But he give us all money to drink Sebastian's
health, and he tell us that as his poor wife dead. Mam Carmaux come keep the
house and bring up little boy.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Did he?&quot; said Julian, and then lapsed into silence as they
rode along. Yet, to himself he said continually: &quot;What is this mystery? What is
the root of it all? What is at the bottom? Somehow I feel as certain as that I
am alive that I was this son--yet--yet--he was pleased--gave money--oh! shall I
ever unravel it all?&quot;</p>

<h4><a name="div1_16" href="#div1Ref_16">CHAPTER XVI.</a></h4>

<h5>A DROP OF BLOOD</h5>
<br>

<p class="normal">They were drawing near the coast now as the
sun sank slowly away over the crest of the Cockscomb mountains towards
Guatemala; and already there were signs that the night--the swift night that
comes to all spots which lie betwixt Capricorn and Cancer--was drawing near.</p>

<p class="normal">The sun, although now hidden behind the topmost ridge of the
Cockscombs, was still an hour above the blue horizon, yet nevertheless the signs
were apparent that he would soon be gone altogether. The parrots and the monkeys
were becoming still and quiet in the branches--that is to say, as still and
quiet as these screeching and chattering creatures ever do become in their
native state--in dark and shade places where now the evening glow scarce
penetrated, the fireflies gleamed little sparks and specks of molten gold;
while, above all, there rose now from the earth that true tropical sign of
coming night, the incense exuded by countless flowers and shrubs, as well as the
cool damp of the earth when refreshed by the absence of the burning sun.
Sometimes, too, across their path, an unmade one, or only made by the tracks of
wild deer or the mountain cow, two or three of the former would glide swiftly
and gracefully, seeking their lair, or the iguana would scuttle before their
animals into the nearest copse, while the quash and gibonet were often visible.</p>

<p class="normal">They rode slowly, not only because of the heat, but also
because none could progress at a swift rate through those tangled copses, the
trees of which were often hung with masses of wild vines whose tendrils met and
interlaced with each other, so that sometimes almost a wall of network was
encountered. Also they rode slowly, because Desolada was but a mile or so off
now, and they would be within its precincts ere the sun was quite gone for the
day. And as they did so in silence, Julian was acknowledging to himself that,
with every fresh person he encountered and every fresh question he asked, his
bewilderment was increased.</p>

<p class="normal">For now, by his side, rode this man, half Spaniard, half
Indian, named Ignacio Paz, who not only had been present at the birth of Mr.
Ritherdon's son, but also had known that son's mother before she was married.
And, Julian asked himself, how did the knowledge now proclaimed by this
man--this man who, if he possessed any feelings towards Sebastian possessed only
those of hatred--this man who had prophesied for him a violent death as the
reward of his brutality and cruelty--how did that knowledge make for or against
the story told by George Ritherdon? Let him see.</p>

<p class="normal">It served above all to corroborate, to establish, Sebastian's
position as the true son and inheritor of Charles Ritherdon. So truly an
acknowledged son and inheritor that, undoubtedly no contrary proof could ever be
brought of sufficiently powerful nature to overwhelm all that the evidence of
the last twenty-five or twenty-six years affirmed. Had not this man, Paz, been
one of those who had received money from Mr. Ritherdon to drink Sebastian's
health? Surely--surely, therefore, the old man was satisfied that this was his
son. And if he, Sebastian, was his son, who then was he, Julian?</p>

<p class="normal">On the other hand, the half-breed proved by old Mr. Leigh's
conversation that there was some inaccuracy--perhaps an intentional
inaccuracy--in Sebastian's statement that Miriam Carmaux, or Gardelle, was a
relative of Isobel Leigh. That was undoubted! There was an inaccuracy. Old Leigh
had definitely said that he was the first of his family who had ever been forced
to earn a living in exile--yet she, this woman, with a French maiden, as well as
married, name, was a native of New Orleans, was a Frenchwoman. Was it not
enormous odds, therefore, against her being any connection of the English girl
with the fair, wheat-coloured hair, the peachlike complexion, and the blue eyes
who had been brought as an infant from Essex to Honduras?</p>

<p class="normal">Also, was it not immeasurably unlikely that, even if then the
women were connected by blood, such coincidences should have occurred that both
should have come to the colony at almost an identical time; that Mr. Ritherdon's
wandering heart should have chanced to be captivated by each of those women;
that he should have jilted the one for the other, and that eventually one, the
jilted woman, should have dropped into the place of mistress of the household
which death had caused the other to resign? What would the doctrine of chances
say in connection with these facts, he would like to know?</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;One other thing perplexes me, too,&quot; he thought to himself, as
now they reached an open glade across which the swift departing sun streamed
horizontally, &quot;perplexes me marvellously. Does Sebastian know, does he dream,
that against his position and standing such a story has been told as that
narrated to me in England by my uncle--as still I believe him to be. And if--if
there is some chicanery, some dark secret in connection with his and my birth,
does he know of it--or is he inno----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He paused, startled now at an incident that had happened, an
incident that drove all reflection from his mind.</p>

<p class="normal">Across that glade there had come trotting easily, and
evidently without any fear on its part, one of the red deer common enough in
British Honduras. Only this deer was not as those are which sportsmen and
hunters penetrate into the forests and the mountains to shoot and destroy;
instead, it was one which Julian had himself seen roaming about the parklike
grounds and surroundings of Desolada, the territory of which began on the other
side of the open glade.</p>

<p class="normal">Yet this was not the incident, nor the portion of the incident
which startled both him and Paz. Not that, but something else more serious than
a tame deer crossing an open grassland a few hundred yards in diameter each way.
There was nothing to startle in that--though much to do so in what followed.</p>

<p class="normal">What followed being that as the deer, still slowly trotting
over the broad-leaved grass, which here forms so luxurious a pasture for all
kinds of cattle, came into line with Julian and Paz riding almost side by side,
though with the latter somewhat ahead of the former--there came from out of the
mangrove trees on the other side of the little opening, a spit of flame, a puff
of smoke, and the sharp crack of a rifle, while, a second later, from off the
side of a logwood tree close by them there fell a strip of bark to the ground.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;By Jove!&quot; exclaimed Julian, his accustomed coolness not
deserting him even at this agitating moment, &quot;the gallant sportsman is a
reckless kind of gentleman. One would think we were the game he is after and not
the deer which, by-the-bye, has departed like a streak of greased lightning. I
say, Paz, that bullet passed about three inches behind your head and not many
more in front of my nose. People don't go out shooting human beings here as they
do partridges at home, do they?&quot; and he turned his eyes on his companion.</p>

<p class="normal">If, as an extra excitement to add to the incident, he had
desired to observe now a specimen of native-born ferocity, he would have been
gratified as he thus regarded Paz. For the man in whose veins ran the hot blood
of a Spaniard, mixed with the still more hot and tempestuous blood of the
Indian, seemed almost beside himself now with rage and fury. His dark
coffee-hued skin had turned livid, his eyes glared like those of a maddened
wolf, and his hands, which were now unstrapping the rifle that he too carried
slung to his saddle, resembled masses of vibrating cords. Yet they became calm
enough as, the antique long-barrelled weapon being released, he raised that
rifle quickly, brought it to the shoulder and fired towards the exact spot
whence they had observed the flame and smoke of the previous rifle to come.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Are you mad?&quot; exclaimed Julian, horrified at the act. &quot;Great
Heavens! Do you want to commit a murder? If the person who let drive at that
deer has not moved away yet, you have very likely taken a human life.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">But Paz, who seemed now to have recovered his equanimity and
to have relieved his feelings entirely by that savage idea of retaliation, which
had been not only sprung into his mind, but had also been instantly put into
practice, only shrugged his shoulders indifferently while he restrapped his
rifle. Then he pointed a long lean finger at the spot across the glade where the
first discharge had taken place, directing the digit next to the spot where the
deer had been, after which he pointed next to their heads and then to the tree,
in which they could see the hole where the bullet was buried two or three
inches. Having done all which, he muttered:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Fired at the deer. At the deer! The deer was
there--there--there,&quot; and he directed his eyes to a spot five yards off the line
which would be drawn between the other side of the glade whence the fire had
come and the deer, &quot;and we are here. Tree here, too.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What do you suspect?&quot; Julian asked, white to the lips now
himself--appalled at some hitherto unsuspected horror. &quot;What? Whom?&quot; And as he
spoke his lips seemed to take the form of a name which, still, he hesitated to
give utterance to.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No,&quot; the half-caste said in reply, his quick intelligence
grasping without the aid of any speech the identity of the man to whom Julian's
expression pointed. &quot;No. He is in Belize by now. He must be there. He has
money--much money--to pay to lawyer this morning. Not him. Not him.&quot; After which
the mysterious creature laughed in a manner that set Julian's mind reflecting on
how he had heard the Indians of old laughed at the tortures endured by their
victims.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Come,&quot; he said now, feeling suddenly cold and chilled, as he
had felt once or twice before in Desolada and its surroundings. &quot;Come, let us go
ho----back to the house,&quot; and he started the mustang forward on the route they
had been following.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No,&quot; Paz exclaimed, &quot;however, not that way now. Other way.
Quite as near. Also,&quot; and his dark eyes glistened strangely as he fastened them
on Julian, &quot;lead to hacienda. To Desolada. Come. We go through wood--over glade.
Very nice wood.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What do you expect to do there?&quot; Julian asked, divining all
the same.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Oh! oh!&quot; Paz said, his face alight with a demoniacal gleam.
&quot;Oh! oh! Perhaps find a body. Who knows? Gunny he shoot very straight. Perhaps a
wounded man. Who knows?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">So they crossed the glade, making straight for the spot whence
the murderous belch of flame had sprung forth, and, pushing aside flowering
cacti and oleanders as well as other lightly knitted together shrubs and bushes,
looked all around them. But, except that there were signs of footmarks on the
bruised leaves of some of the greater shrubs and also that the undergrowth was a
little trodden down, they saw nothing. Certainly nobody lay there, struck to
death by Paz's bullet.</p>

<p class="normal">The keen eyes of the half-caste--glinting here and there and
everywhere--and looking like dark topazes as the rays of the evening sun danced
in them--seemed, however, to penetrate each inch of the surrounding shrubbery.
And, at last, Julian heard him give a little gasp--it was almost a bleat--and
saw him point with his finger at something about three feet from the ground.</p>

<p class="normal">At a leaf--a leaf of the wild oleander--on which was a speck
that looked like a ladybird. Only--it was not that! But, instead, a drop of
blood. A drop that glistened, as his eyes had glistened in the sun; a drop that
a step or two further onward had a fellow. Then--nothing further.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I hit him,&quot; Paz said, &quot;somewhere. Only--did not kill.&quot; While,
instantly he wheeled round and gazed full into Julian's eyes--his face
expressing a very storm of demoniacal hate against the late owner of that drop.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;That,&quot; he almost hissed, &quot;will keep. For a later day. When I
know him.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">They went now toward the house, each intent on his own
meditations and with hardly a word spoken between them; or, at least, but a few
words: Julian requesting Paz to say nothing of the incident, and the latter
replying that by listening and not talking was the way to discover a secret.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Ha! the gentle lady,&quot; said the half-breed now, as they
observed Madame Carmaux seated on the veranda arranging some huge lilies in a
glass bowl, while the form of Zara was observed disappearing into the house.
&quot;Ha! the gracious ruler and mistress.&quot; Then, as they drew near and stepped on to
the veranda, Paz began bowing and scraping before the former with extraordinary
deference. Yet, all the same, Julian observed that his eyes were roving
everywhere around, and all over the boards near where Madame Carmaux sat, so
that he wondered what it was for which the half-breed sought!</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="div1_17" href="#div1Ref_17">CHAPTER XVII.</a></h4>

<h5>&quot;SHE HATES HIM BECAUSE SHE LOVES HIM.&quot;</h5>
<br>

<p class="normal">&quot;It would be folly,&quot; said Julian to himself
that night, &quot;not to recognise at once that each moment I spend in this house,
or, indeed in this locality, is full of danger to me. Therefore, from this
moment I commence to take every precaution that is possible. Now let us think
out how to do it.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">On this occasion he was the sole occupant of the lower
veranda, in spite of its being quite early in the evening, and owing to the fact
that Sebastian was passing the night in Belize, while Madame Carmaux, having
announced that she had a severe headache, had taken herself off to her own room
before supper, he had partaken of that meal alone. So that he sat there quite by
himself now, smoking; and, as a matter of fact, he was not at all sorry to do
so.</p>

<p class="normal">He recognised that any attempt at conversation with the
&quot;gentle lady&quot; as Paz had termed her--in an undoubtedly ironical and subacid
manner--was the veriest make-believe; while, as to Sebastian, when he was at
home--well, his conversation was absolutely uninteresting. He never talked of
anything but gambling and the shortness of ready money, diversified occasionally
by a torrent of questions as to what George Ritherdon had done and what he had
said during the whole time of his life in England. While, as Julian reflected,
or, indeed, now felt perfectly sure, that even this wearisome talk was but
assumed as a mask or cloak to the other's real thoughts, it was not likely that
Sebastian's absence to-night could be a cause of much regret.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Let me think out how to do it,&quot; he said again, continuing his
meditations; &quot;let me regard the whole thing from its proper aspect. I am in
danger. But of what at the worst? Well, at the worst--death. There is, it is
very evident, a strong determination on the part of some people in this place to
relieve the colony of my interesting presence. First, Sebastian tries to break
my neck with an untrained horse; next, some one probably places a coral snake in
my bed; while, thirdly, some creature of his endeavours to shoot me. Paz--who
seems to have imbibed many ancient ideas from his Spanish and savage
ancestors--appears, however, if I understand him, to imagine he was the person
shot at, his wild and barbaric notions about the sacredness of the guest making
him suppose, apparently that my life could not be the one aimed at. Well, let
him think so. At any rate, his feelings of revenge and hatred are kept at
boiling-pitch against some unknown enemy.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Now,&quot; he went on, with still that light and airy manner of
looking at difficulties (even difficulties that at this time seemed to be
assuming a horrible, not to say, hideous, aspect) which had long since endeared
him to countless comrades in the wardroom and elsewhere. &quot;Now, I will take a
little walk in the cool of the evening. Dear Madame Carmaux's headache has
deprived her of the pearls of my conversation, wherefore I will, as her
countrymen say, 'go and take the air.'&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Upon which he rose from his seat, and, pushing aside the
wicker table on which stood a bottle of Bourbon whisky, a syphon, and also a pen
and ink with some writing-paper, he took from off it a letter directed and
stamped, and dropped it into the pocket of his white jacket.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;The creole negro--as they call those chaps here--passes the
foot of the garden in five minutes' time,&quot; he said to himself, looking at a fine
gold watch which he had gained as a prize at Greenwich, &quot;and he will convey this
to Spranger's hands. Afterwards, from to-night, I will make it my business to
send one off from All Pines every day. I should like Spranger and Beat--I mean
Miss Spranger--to receive a daily bulletin of my health henceforth.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Sebastian,&quot; he continued to reflect, as now he made his way
beneath the palms towards where the road ran, far down at the foot of the
garden, &quot;has meditations about being my heir--well, so have I about being his.
Yet I think, I do really think, I would rather be Sebastian's if it's all the
same to him. Nevertheless, in case anything uncomfortable should happen to me, I
should like Spranger and Beat--Miss Spranger, to be acquainted with the fact. It
might make the succession easier to--Sebastian.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He heard the &quot;creole negro's&quot; cart coming along, even as he
reached the road; he heard also the chuckles and whoops with which the conveyer
of her Majesty's mails urged on the flea-bitten, raw-boned creature that carried
them; and then, the cart drew into sight and was pulled up suddenly as Julian
emerged into the road.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Hoop! Massa Sebastian, you give me drefful fright,&quot; the sable
driver began, &quot;thought it was your ghost, as I see you in Belize this berry
morning----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;So it would have been his ghost,&quot; remarked Julian, as he came
close to the cart with the letter in his hand, &quot;if you had happened to see him
now. Meanwhile, kindly take this letter and put it in your mail-bag.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Huah! huah!&quot; grunted the negro, while he held out his great
black hand for the missive and, opening the mouth of the bag which was in the
cart behind him, thrust it in on the top of all the others he had collected on
his route along the coast; &quot;he get there all right about two o'clock this
morning. But, massa, you berry like Massa Sebastian. In um white jacket you
passy well for um ghost or brudder.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;So they tell me,&quot; Julian answered lightly. &quot;But, you see, we
happen to be cousins, and, sometimes, cousins are as much alike as brothers. My
friend,&quot; he said, changing the subject, &quot;are you a teetotaller?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Hoop! Huah! Teetotallum. Huah! Teetotallum! Yes, massa, when
I've no money. Then berry good teetotallum. Berry good.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Well, now see, here is some money,&quot; and he gave the man a
small piece of silver. &quot;Take a drink at All Pines as you go by; it will keep
this limekiln sort of air out of your throat--or wash it down. Off with you,
only take two drinks. Have the second when you get to Belize.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Profuse in thanks, the darkey drove off, wishing Julian
good-night, while the latter's cheery, &quot;Good-night, fair nymph,&quot; seemed to him
so exquisite a piece of humour that, for some paces along the road, the former
could hear him chuckling and murmuring in his musical bass: &quot;Fair nymph. Hoah!
Fair nymph. Hoah! Fair nymph. That's me.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Now,&quot; Julian said to himself as he strolled along the road,
&quot;we shall see if Spranger comes to meet me as he said he would if I wanted his
assistance. If he doesn't, then bang goes this one into the All Pines post-box
to-morrow;&quot; the &quot;this one&quot; being an exact duplicate of the letter which the
negro postman had at that moment in his mail-bag.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I'm getting incredibly cunning,&quot; Julian murmured to himself,
&quot;shockingly so. Yet, what is one to do? One must meet ruse with ruse and cunning
with cunning, and I do believe Sebastian is as artful as a waggon-load of
monkeys. However, if things go wrong with me, if I should get ill--Sebastian
says the climate is bad and lays a good deal of stress on the fact, although
other people say it's first-rate---or disappear, or furnish a subject for a
first-class funeral, there is one consolation. Spranger, on not hearing from me,
will soon begin to make inquiries and, as the novelists say, 'I shall not die
unavenged.' That's something.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">It is permissible for those who record veracious chronicles
such as this present one, to do many things that in ordinary polite society
would not be tolerated. Thus, we have accompanied Julian to his bedchamber on
more than one occasion, and now we will look over his shoulder as, an hour
before this period, he indited the letter to Mr. Spranger (which at the present
moment is in the Belize post-cart), and afterwards made a copy of it for posting
the next day at All Pines.</p>

<p class="normal">It was not a lengthy document--since the naval officer
generally writes briefly, succinctly and to the purpose--and simply served to
relate the various startling &quot;incidents&quot; which had occurred after he had
returned to Desolada. And he told Mr. Spranger that, henceforth, a letter would
be posted for him at All Pines every day, which, so long as it conveyed no
tidings of ill news, required no answer; but that, if such letter should fail to
come, then Spranger might imagine that he stood in need of succour. It concluded
by saying that if this gentleman had a few hours to spare next day and could
meet him half-way betwixt Belize and Desolada--say, opposite a spot called
Commerce Bight--he would take it as a favour--would meet him, say, in the early
morning, about ten o'clock, before the heat was too great.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Sebastian,&quot; the letter ended, &quot;seems to harp more, now, on
the fact that he's my heir than on anything else. He evidently imagines that I
have more to leave than I have. But, however that may be, I don't want him to
inherit yet.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He was thinking about this letter, and its duplicate which was
to follow to-morrow, if the first one did not bring his friend from Belize, when
he heard voices near him--voices that were pitched low and coming closer with
every step he took, and then, suddenly, he came upon the girl, Zara, and the
man, Ignacio Paz, walking along the road side by side.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Well, my Queen of Night,&quot; he said to the former, &quot;and how are
you? You heard that I found the snake after all, I suppose?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, I heard,&quot; the girl said, her dark slumbrous eyes
gleaming at him in the light of the stars. &quot;I heard. Better always look. This is
a dangerous land. Very dangerous to white men.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;So Sebastian tells me. Thank you, Zara. Henceforth I will be
sure to look. I am going to take a great deal of care of my precious health
while I am in this neighbourhood.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;That is well,&quot; the girl said; then, having noticed his
bantering manner, she added, &quot;you may laugh--make joke, but it is no joke. Take
care,&quot; and a moment later she was gone swiftly up to the house, leaving him and
his companion of the morning standing together in the dusty road.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I wonder why Zara is such a good friend of mine?&quot; Julian
asked meditatively now, looking into the eyes of Paz, which themselves gleamed
brightly.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You wonder?&quot; the half-caste said, with that bleating little
laugh which always sounded so strangely in Julian's ears. &quot;<i>Do</i> you wonder?
Can't you guess? Do you wonder, too, why I'm a friend of yours?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You, Paz! Why we've only known each other about fifteen
hours. Though I'm glad to hear it, all the same.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Friends long enough to nearly get killed together to-day,&quot;
the man replied. &quot;That's one reason.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And the other--Zara's reasons? What are they?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Again the man's eyes glistened in the starlight; then he put
out his long lithe finger, which, Indianlike, he used to emphasize most of his
remarks.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;She hates him. So do I.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You I can understand. He beat you this morning. But--Zara! I
thought she was his faithful adherent.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;She hates him because,&quot; the man replied laconically, &quot;she
loves him.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Loves him. And he? Well--what?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Not love her. He love 'nother. English missy. You know her.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I do,&quot; Julian answered emphatically. &quot;I do. Now, I'll add my
share to this little love story. She, the English missy, does not love him.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Zara think she do. Thinks he with her now. Go Belize, see
her.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Bah! Bosh! The English missy wouldn't--why, Paz,&quot; he broke
off suddenly, &quot;what's this in your hand? Haven't you had enough sport to-day--or
are you going out shooting the owls to-night for a change?&quot; while as he spoke he
pointed to a small rifle the half-caste held in his hand. &quot;Though,&quot; he added,
&quot;one doesn't shoot birds with rifles.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No,&quot; the other replied, with again the bleat, and with, now,
his eyes blazing--&quot;no. Shoot men with him. Nearly shoot one to-day. I find him
near where I find drop of blood this afternoon. Hid away under ferns. I take a
little walk this evening in the cool. Then I find him.&quot;</p>

<h5>SEBASTIAN IS DISTURBED</h5>
<br>

<p class="normal">&quot;This knoll is becoming historic,&quot; Julian
said to himself the next morning, as he halted the mustang where twice he had
halted it before, when he had been journeying the other way from that which he
had now come. &quot;When, some day, the life and adventures of Admiral Ritherdon,
K.C.B., and so forth, are given to an admiring world, it must figure in them.
Make a pretty frontispiece, too, with its big shady palms and the blue sea
beyond the mangroves down below.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">In spite, however, of his bright and buoyant nature, which
refused to be depressed or subdued by the atmosphere of doubt or suspicion--to
give that atmosphere no more important name--he recognised very clearly that
matters were serious with him. He knew, too, that the calamities which had
approached, without absolutely overwhelming him--so far--were something more
than coincidences; natural enough as each by itself might have been in a country
which, even now, can scarcely be called anything else than a wild and unsettled
one.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I was once flung off a horse, a buckjumper,&quot; he reflected,
&quot;in Western Australia when I was a 'sub'; I found a snake in my bed in Burmah;
and a chap shot at me once in Vera Cruz--but--but,&quot; and he nodded his head
meditatively over his recollections, &quot;the whole lot did not happen together in
Australia or Burmah or Vera Cruz. If they had done so, it would have appeared
rather pointed. And--well--they
<i>have</i> all happened together here. That looks rather pointed, too.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;All the same,&quot; Julian went on reflectively, as now he
tethered the mustang to a bush where it could stand in the shade, and also drew
himself well under the spreading branches of the palms--&quot;all the same, I can't
and won't believe that Sebastian sees danger to his very firmly-established
rights by my presence here. He said on that first night to Madame Carmaux,
'Knowledge is not proof,' and what proof have I against him? This copy of my
baptism at New Orleans which I possess can't outweigh that entry of his birth
which Spranger has seen in Belize. And there is nothing else. Nothing! Except
George Ritherdon's statement to me, which nobody would believe. My own opinion
is,&quot; he concluded, &quot;that Sebastian, who at the best is a rough, untutored
specimen of the remote colonist, with very little knowledge of the world beyond,
thinks that if anything happened to me he would only have to put in a claim to
whatever I have in England, prove his cousinship, and be put in possession of my
few thousands. What a sublime confidence he must have in the simplicity of the
English laws!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Even, however, as he thought all this, there came to him a
recollection, a revived memory, of something that had struck him after George
Ritherdon's death--something that, in the passage of so many other stirring
events, had of late vanished from his mind.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He said,&quot; Julian murmured to himself--&quot;my uncle said in the
letter I received when we got back to Portsmouth, that he had commenced to write
down the error, the crime of his life, in case he did not live to see me.
And--and--later--after he had told me all, on the next day, he remarked that the
whole account was written down; that when--poor old fellow! he was gone I should
find it in his desk; that it would serve to refresh my memory. But--I never did
find it, and, I suppose, he thought it was best destroyed. I wish, however, he
hadn't done it; even his handwriting would have been some corroboration of the
statement. At least it would have shown, if I ever do make the statement public,
that I had not invented it.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">While he had been indulging in these meditations he had kept
his eyes fixed on the long, white, dusty road that stretched from where the
knoll was on which he sat toward Belize; a road which, through this flat
country, could be traced for two or three miles, it looking like a white thread
lying on a dark green carpet the colour of which had been withered by the sun.</p>

<p class="normal">And now, as he looked, he saw upon the farthest end of that
thread a speck, even whiter than itself--a speck, that is to say, white above
and black beneath--which was gradually travelling along the road, coming nearer
and growing bigger each moment.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It may be Mr. Spranger,&quot; he thought to himself, still
watching the oncoming party-coloured patch as it continued to loom larger;
&quot;probably is. Yet for a man of his time of life, and in such a baker's oven as
that road is, he is a bold rider. I hope he won't get a sunstroke or a touch of
heat apoplexy in his efforts to come and meet me.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">At last, however, the person, whoever it was, drew so near
that the rider's white tropical jacket stood out quite distinct from the black
coat of the animal he bestrode; while, also, the great white sombrero on the
man's head was distinctly visible.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;That's not Spranger,&quot; Julian said to himself, &quot;but a much
younger man. By Jove!&quot; he exclaimed, &quot;it's Sebastian. And I might have expected
it to be him. Of course. It is about the time he would be returning to
Desolada.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">His recognition of his cousin was scarcely accomplished beyond
all doubt, when Sebastian's horse began to slow down in its stride, owing to
having commenced the ascent of the incline that led up to the knoll where Julian
sat, and in a very few more moments the animal, emitting great gusts from its
nostrils, had brought its rider close to where he was. While, true to his
determination to exhibit no outward sign of anything he might suspect concerning
Sebastian's designs toward him, as well as to resolve to assume a light and
cheerful manner, and also a friendly one, Julian called out pleasantly:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Halloa, Sebastian! How are you this fine morning? Rather a
hot ride from Belize, isn't it?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">If, however, he had expected an equally cordial greeting in
return, or, to put it in other and more appropriate words, a similar piece of
acting on Sebastian's part, he was very considerably mistaken. For, instead of
his cousin returning his cheerful salutation in a corresponding manner, his
reception of it betokened something that might very well have been considered to
be dismay. Indeed, he reined his horse up so suddenly as almost to throw the
panting creature on its haunches, in spite of the ascent it was making; while
his face, sunbrowned and burned as it was, seemed to grow nearly livid behind
the bronze. His eyes also had in them the startled expression which might
possibly be observed in those of a man who had suddenly been confronted by a
spectre.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Why!&quot; he said, a moment later, after peering about and around
and into all the rich luxuriant vegetation which grew on the knoll, as though he
might have expected to see some other person sitting among the wild allamandas
or ixoras--&quot;why, what on earth are you doing here, Julian? I--I thought you were
at Desolada, or--or perhaps out shooting again. By the way, I had left Desolada
before you were up yesterday morning; what sort of a day did you have of it?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Most exciting,&quot; Julian replied, himself as cool as ice.
&quot;Quite a field-day.&quot; And then he went on to give his cousin, who had by now
dismounted and was sitting near him, a <i>résumé</i> of the whole day's
adventures--not forgetting to tell him also of the interesting discovery of the
coral snake in his bed.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;If,&quot; he thought to himself, &quot;he wants to see how little he
can frighten one of her Majesty's sailors, he shall see it now.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He had, however, some slight hesitation in narrating the
retaliation of Paz upon the unknown, would-be assassin--for such the person must
have been who had fired at where the deer was not--he being in some doubt as to
how this fact would be received.</p>

<p class="normal">At first it was listened to in silence, Sebastian only
testifying how much he was impressed at the recountal by the manner in which he
kept his eyes fixed on Julian--and also by the whiteness of his lips, to which
the circulation seemed unable to find its way. Also, it seemed as though, when
he heard of the drop of blood upon the leaf, once more the blood in his own
veins was impeded--and as if his heart was standing still. Then, when the
recital was concluded, he said:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Paz did right. It was a cowardly affair. I wish he had killed
the villain. I suppose it was some enemies of his. Some fellow half-caste. Paz
has enemies,&quot; he added.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Probably,&quot; said Julian quietly.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And,&quot; went on Sebastian now in a voice of considerable
equanimity, though still his bronze and sunburn were not what they usually were;
&quot;and how did you leave Madame Carmaux? Was she not horrified at such a dastardly
outrage?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I did not have much time with her. Not time enough indeed to
tell her. She went to bed directly I got back----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Went to bed! Why?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;She was not well. Said she had a headache, or rather sent
word to that effect. Nor did she come down to breakfast. Rather slow, you know,
all alone by myself, so I thought I'd come on here for a ride. Must do something
with one's time.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Of course! Of course! I told you Desolada was Liberty Hall.
Went to bed, eh? I hope she is not really ill. I don't know what I should do
without her,&quot; and as he spoke Julian observed that, if anything, he was whiter
than before. Evidently he was very much distressed at Madame Carmaux's suffering
from even so trifling an ailment as a headache.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I think I'll get on now,&quot; Sebastian said, rising from where
he was sitting. &quot;If she is laid up I shall have a good deal of extra work to do,
I suppose it really is a headache.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I suppose it is,&quot; Julian said, &quot;it is not likely to be much
else. She was arranging flowers in a vase when Paz and I returned.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Was she!&quot; Sebastian exclaimed, almost gleefully; &quot;was she!
Oh, well! then there can't be much the matter with her, can there? I am glad to
hear that. But, anyhow, I'll go on now. You'll be back by sundown, I suppose.
You know it's bad to be out just at sunset. The climate is a tricky one.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;So I have heard you say. Never mind, I'll be back in the
evening, or before. Meanwhile I may wander into the woods and shoot a monkey or
so.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Shoot! Why! you haven't got a gun with you,&quot; Sebastian
exclaimed, looking on the ground and at the mustang's back where, probably, such
a thing would have been strapped.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No, I haven't. But I've always got this,&quot; and he showed the
handle of his revolver in an inside pocket.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You're a wise man. Though, if you knew the colony better,
you'd understand there isn't much danger to human life here.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;There was yesterday. And Paz has taught me a trick or two. If
any one fired at me now I should do just what he did, and, perhaps, I too might
find a leaf with a drop of blood on it afterwards.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You're a cool fish!&quot; exclaimed Sebastian after bursting out
into a loud laugh which, somehow, didn't seem to have much of the ring of mirth
in it. &quot;Upon my word you are. Well, so long! Don't go committing murder, that's
all.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No, I won't. Bye-bye. I'll be back to-night.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">After which exchange of greetings, Sebastian got on his horse
and prepared to continue his journey to Desolada.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;By the way,&quot; he said, however, before doing so, &quot;about that
snake! How could it have got into your bed?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;<i>I</i> don't know,&quot; Julian replied with a half laugh. &quot;How
should I? The coral snake is a new acquaintance, though I've known other
specimens in my time. It got there somehow, didn't it?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Of course! They love warmth, you know. Perhaps it climbed up
the legs of the bed and crept in where it would be covered up.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It was rather rude to do such a thing in a visitor's bed
though, wasn't it? It isn't as though I was one of the residents. And it must
have been a clever chap, too, because it got in without disarranging the
mosquito curtains the least little bit. That <i>was</i> clever, when you come to
think of it!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">At which Sebastian gave a rather raucous kind of laugh, and
then set his horse in motion.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;<i>Au revoir!</i>&quot; said Julian. &quot;I hope you'll find Madame
Carmaux much better when you get back.&quot;</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="div1_19" href="#div1Ref_19">CHAPTER XIX.</a></h4>

<h5>A PLEASANT MEETING</h5>
<br>

<p class="normal">The morning was drawing on and it was
getting late--that is, for the tropics--namely, it was near nine o'clock, and
soon the sun would be high in the heavens, so that it was not likely along the
dusty white road from Belize any sign of human life would make it appearance
until sunset was close at hand.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;If Mr. Spranger doesn't come pretty soon,&quot; Julian said
consequently to himself, &quot;he won't come at all, and has, probably, important
business to attend to in the city. Wherefore I shall have to pass to-day alone
here, or have a sunstroke before I can get as far back as All Pines for a meal.
I ought to have brought some lunch with me.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Halloa, my friend,&quot; he remarked a moment later to the
mustang, which had commenced to utter little whinnies, and seemed to be
regarding him with rather a piteous sort of look, &quot;what's the matter with you?
You don't want to start back and get a sunstroke, do you? Oh! I know. Of
course!&quot; and he rose from his seat and, going further into the bushes behind the
knoll, began to use both his eyes and his ears. For it had not taken him a
moment to divine--he who had been round the world three times! that the creature
required that which in all tropical lands is wanted by man and animal more than
anything else--namely, the wherewithal to quench their thirst.</p>

<p class="normal">Presently, he heard the grateful sound of trickling water,
which in British Honduras is bountifully supplied by Providence, and discovered
a swift-flowing rivulet on its way to the sea below--it being, in fact, a little
tributary of Mullin's River--when, going back for the creature, he led it to
where the water was, while, tying its bridle to some reeds, he left it there to
quench its thirst. After which he returned to the summit of the knoll to
continue his lookout along the road from Belize.</p>

<p class="normal">But now he saw that, during his slight absence, some signs of
other riders had appeared, there being at this present moment two
black-and-white blurs upon the white dusty thread. Two that progressed side by
side, and presented a duplicate, party-coloured imitation of that which,
earlier, Sebastian Ritherdon and his steed had offered to his view.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;If that's Mr. Spranger,&quot; Julian thought to himself, &quot;he has
brought a companion with him, or has picked up a fellow traveller. By Jove
though! one's a darkey and, well! I declare, the other's a woman. Oh!&quot; he
exclaimed suddenly, joyfully too; &quot;it's Miss Spranger. Here's luck!&quot; and with
that, regardless of the sun's rays and all the calamities that those rays can
bring in such a land, he jumped into the road and began waving his handkerchief
violently.</p>

<p class="normal">The signal, he saw, was returned at once; from beneath the
huge green umbrella held over the young lady's head--and his own--by the negro
accompanying her, he observed an answering handkerchief waved, and then the mass
of white material which formed a veil thrown back, as though she was desirous
that he who was regarding her should not be in any doubt as to who was
approaching. Yet, she need not have been thus desirous. There is generally one
form (as the writer has been told by those who know) which, when we are young,
or sometimes even, no longer boys and girls, we recognise easily enough, no
matter how much it may be disguised by veils or dust-coats or other similar
impediments to our sight.</p>

<p class="normal">Naturally, Beatrix and her sable companion rode slowly--to
ride fast here on such a morning means death, or something like it--but they
reached the knoll at last, and then, after mutual greetings had been exchanged
and Julian had lifted Miss Spranger off her horse--one may suppose how
tenderly!--she said:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Father was sorry, but he could not come. So I came instead. I
hope you don't mind.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Mind!&quot; he said, while all the time he was thinking how pretty
she looked in her white dress, and how fascinating the line which marked the
distinction between the sunburn of her face and the whiteness of her throat made
her appear--&quot;mind!&quot; Then, words seeming somehow to fail him (who rarely was at a
loss for such things, either for the purpose of jest or earnest) at this moment,
he contented himself with a glance only, and in preparing for her a suitable
seat in the shade. Yet, all the same, he was impelled directly afterwards to
tell her again and again how much he felt her goodness in coming at all.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Jupiter,&quot; she said to the negro now, &quot;bring the horses in
under the shade and unsaddle and unbridle them. And, find some 'water for them.
I am going to stay quite a time, you know,&quot; she went on, addressing Julian. &quot;I
can't go back till sunset, or near sunset, so you will have to put up with my
company for a whole day. I suppose you didn't happen to think of bringing any
lunch or other provisions?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;The mere man is forgetful,&quot; he replied contritely, finding
his tongue once more, &quot;so----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;So I am aware. Therefore, I have brought some myself. Oh!
yes, quite enough for two, Mr. Ritherdon; therefore you need not begin to say
you are not hungry or anything of that sort. Later, Jupiter shall unpack it.
Meanwhile, we have other things to think and talk about. Now, please, go on with
that,&quot; and she pointed to the pipe in his hand which he had let go out in her
presence, &quot;and tell me everything. Everything from the time you left us.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Obedient to her orders and subject to no evesdropping by the
discreet Jupiter--who, having been told by Julian where the rivulet was, had
conducted the two fresh horses there and was now seated on the bank crooning a
mournful ditty which, the former thought, might have been sung by some African
sorcerer to his barbaric ancestors--he did tell her everything. He omitted
nothing, from the finding of the coral-snake in his bed to his last meeting with
Sebastian half an hour ago.</p>

<p class="normal">While the girl sitting there by his side, her pure clear eyes
sometimes fixed on the narrator's face and sometimes gazing meditatively on the
sapphire Caribbean sparkling a mile off in front of them, listened to and drank
in and weighed every word.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Lieutenant Ritherdon,&quot; she said, when he had concluded, and
placing her hand boldly, and without any absurd false shame, upon his sleeve,
&quot;you must give me a promise--a solemn promise--that you will never go back to
that place again.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;But!&quot; he exclaimed startled, &quot;I must go back. I cannot leave
and give up my quest like that. And,&quot; he added, a little gravely, &quot;remember I am
a sailor, an officer. I cannot allow myself to be frightened away from my search
in such a manner.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Not for----&quot; she began interrupting.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Not for what?&quot; he asked eagerly, feeling that if she said,
&quot;not for my sake?&quot; he must comply.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Not for your life? Its safety? Not for that?&quot; she concluded,
almost to his disappointment. &quot;May you not retreat to preserve your life?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No,&quot; he answered a moment later. &quot;No, not even for that. For
my own self-respect, my own self-esteem I must not do so. Miss Spranger,&quot; he
continued, speaking almost rapidly now, &quot;I know well enough that I shall do no
good there; I have come to understand at last that I shall never discover the
truth of the matter. Yet I do believe all the same that George Ritherdon was my
uncle, that Charles Ritherdon was my father, that Sebastian Ritherdon is
a--well, that there is some tricking, some knavery in it all. But,&quot; he continued
bitterly, &quot;the trickery has been well played, marvellously well managed, and I
shall never unearth the method by which it has been done.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yet, thinking this, you will not retreat! You will jeopardize
your life?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I have begun,&quot; he said, &quot;and I cannot retreat, short of
absolute, decisive failure. Of certain failure! And, oh! you must see why, you
must understand why, I can not--it is because my life is in jeopardy that I
cannot do so. I embarked on this quest expecting to find no difficulties, no
obstacles in my way; I came to this country and, at once, I learned that my
appearance here, at Desolada, meant deadly peril to me. And, because of that
deadly peril, I must, I will, go on. I will not draw back; nor be frightened by
any danger. If I did I should hate myself forever afterwards; I should know
myself unworthy to ever wear her Majesty's uniform again. I will never draw
back,&quot; he repeated emphatically, &quot;while the danger continues to exist.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">As he had spoken, Julian Ritherdon--the bright, cheery
Englishman, full of joke and quip, had disappeared: in his place had come
another Julian--the Englishman of stern determination, of iron nerve; the man
who, because peril stared him in the face and environed his every footstep, was
resolute to never retreat before that danger.</p>

<p class="normal">While she, the girl sitting by his side, her eyes beaming with
admiration (although he did not see them), knew that, as he had said, so he
would do. This man--fair, young, good-looking, and
<i>insouciant</i>--was, beneath all that his intercourse with the world and
society had shaped him into being, as firm as steel, as solid as a rock.</p>

<p class="normal">What could she answer in return?</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;If you are so determined,&quot; she said now, controlling her
voice for fear that, through it, she should betray her admiration for his
strength and courage, &quot;you will, at least take every measure for your
self-preservation. Write every day, as you have said you will in your letter to
my father, be ever on your guard--by night and day. Oh!&quot; she went on, thrusting
her hands through the beautiful hair from which she had removed her large Panama
hat for coolness while in the shade, &quot;I sicken with apprehension when I think of
you alone in that mournful, mysterious house.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You need not,&quot; he said, and now he too ventured to touch her
sleeve as she had previously touched his--&quot;you need not do so. Remember, it is
man to man at the worst; Sebastian Ritherdon--if he is Sebastian
Ritherdon--against Julian. And I, at least, am used to facing risks and dangers.
It is my trade.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No,&quot; she answered, almost with a shudder, while her lustrous
eyes expressed something that was very nearly, if not quite, horror--&quot;no! it is
not. It is a man and a woman--and that a crafty, scheming woman--against a man.
Against you. Lieutenant Ritherdon,&quot; she cried, &quot;can you doubt who--who----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Hush,&quot; he said, &quot;hush. Not yet. Let us judge no one yet.
Though I--believe me--<i>I</i> doubt nothing. <i>I</i>, too, can understand.
But,&quot; he went on a little more lightly now, &quot;remember, Sebastian is not the only
one possessed of a female auxiliary, of female support. Remember, I have Zara.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Zara,&quot; she repeated meditatively, &quot;Zara. The girl with whom
he amused himself by making believe that he loved her; made her believe that,
when this precious Madame Carmaux should be removed, she might reign over his
house as his wife.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Did he do that?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He did. If all accounts are true he led her to believe he
loved her until he thought another woman--a woman who would not have let him
serve her as a groom--might look favourably on his pretensions.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Therefore,&quot; said Julian, ignoring the latter part of her
remark, though understanding not only it, but the deep contempt of her tone,
&quot;therefore, now she hates him. May she not be a powerful ally of mine, in
consequence. That is, if she does hate him, as my other ally--Paz--says.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, yes,&quot; Beatrix said, still musing, still reflectively.
&quot;Yet, if so, why those mysterious visits to your bedroom window, why that
haunting the neighbourhood of your room at midnight?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I understand those visits now, I think I understand them,
since the episode of the coral snake. I believe she was constituting herself a
watch, a guard over me. That she knows much--that--that she suspects more. That
she will at the worst, if it comes, help me to--to thwart him.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Ah! if it were so. If I could believe it.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And Paz, too. Sebastian told me to-day that Paz has enemies.
Well! doubtless he has--only, I would rather be Paz than one of those enemies.
You would think so yourself if you had seen the blaze of the man's eyes, the
look upon his face, when that shot was fired, and, later, when he showed me the
rifle which he had found close by the spot. No; I should not like to be one of
Paz's enemies nor--a false lover of Zara's.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;If I could feel as confident as you!&quot; Beatrix exclaimed. &quot;Oh!
if I could. Then--then--&quot; but she could find no ending for her sentence.</p>

<h5>LOVE'S BLOSSOM</h5>
<br>

<p class="normal">A fortnight had elapsed since that meeting
on the palm-clad knoll, and Julian was still an inmate of Desolada. But each day
as it came and went--while it only served to intensify his certainty that some
strange trickery had been practised at the time when he was gone and when George
Ritherdon had stolen him from his dying, or dead, mother's side--served also to
convince him that he would never find out the manner in which the deceit had
been practised, nor unravel the clue to that deceit. He had, too, almost decided
to take his farewell of Desolada and its inmates, to shake the dust of the place
off his shoes, and to abandon any idea of endeavouring to obtain further
corroboration of his uncle's statement.</p>

<p class="normal">For he had come to believe, to fear, that no corroboration was
to be found. Every one in British Honduras regarded Sebastian as the undoubted
child and absolute heir of the late Charles Ritherdon, while, in addition, there
were still scores of persons alive, black and white and half-caste, who
remembered the birth of the boy, though not one individual could be discovered
who had heard even a whisper of any kidnapping having ever taken place. Once,
Julian had thought that a journey to New Orleans and a verification of the copy
of his baptismal certificate with the original might be of some use, but on
reflection he had decided that this, as against the certificate of Sebastian's
baptism in Belize, would be of no help whatever.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is indeed a dead wall, a solid rock, against which I am
pushing, as Mr. Spranger said,&quot; he muttered to himself again and again. &quot;And it
is too firm for me. I shall have to retreat--not because I fear my foe, but
because that foe has no tangible shape against which to contend.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He had not returned to Desolada on the night that followed his
meeting with, first, Sebastian on the knoll and then with Beatrix; he making his
appearance at that place about dawn on the following morning. The reason whereof
was, that, after passing the whole day with Miss Spranger on that spot (the
lunch she had brought with her being amply sufficient to provide an afternoon,
or evening, meal), he had insisted on escorting her back to her father's house.</p>

<p class="normal">At first she protested against his doing this, she declaring
that Jupiter was quite sufficient cavalier for her, but he would take no denial
and was firm in his resolve to do so. He did not tell her, though (as perhaps,
there was no necessity for him to do, since, if all accounts are true, young
ladies are very apt at discovering the inward workings of those whom they like
and by whom they are liked), that he regarded this opportunity as a most
fortuitous one, and, as such, not to be missed. Who is there amongst us all who,
given youth and strength and the near presence of a woman whom we are fast
beginning to love with our whole heart, would not sacrifice a night's rest to
ride a score of miles by her side? Not one who is worthy to win that woman's
love!</p>

<p class="normal">So through the tropical night--where high above them blazed
the constellations of the Southern Crown, the Peacock, and the Archer, with
their incandescentlike glow--those two rode side by side; the negro on ahead and
casting many a glance of caution around at bush and shrub and clump of palm and
mangrove. Of love they did not speak, for a sufficient reason; each knew that it
was growing and blossoming in the other's heart--that it was there! The man's
love there--in his heart, not only because of the girl's winsome beauty; but
born and created also by the knowledge that she went hand in hand with him in
all that he was endeavouring to accomplish; the woman's love engendered by her
recognition of his bravery and strength of character. If she had not come to
love him before, she did so when he exclaimed that, because the danger was near
to and threatening him, he would never desist from the task on which he had
embarked.</p>

<p class="normal">But love often testifies its existence otherwise than in
words, and it did so now--not only in the subdued tones of their voices as they
fell on the luscious sultry air of the night, but also in the understanding
which they came to as to how they should be in constant communication with each
other in the future, so that, if aught of evil befell Julian at Desolada,
Beatrix might not be long unaware of the evil.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Perhaps,&quot; Julian said, as now they were drawing near
Belize--&quot;perhaps it will not be necessary that I should apprise you each day of
my safety, of the fact that everything is all right with me. Therefore----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I must know frequently! hear often,&quot; Beatrix said, turning
her eyes on him. &quot;I must. Oh! Mr. Ritherdon, forty-eight hours will appear an
eternity to me, knowing, as I shall know, that you are in that dreadful house.
Alone, too, and with none to help you. What may they not attempt against you
next!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Whatever they attempt,&quot; he replied, &quot;will, I believe, be
thwarted. I take Paz and Zara--especially Zara, now that you tell me she is a
jilted woman--against Sebastian and Madame Carmaux. But, to return to my
communications with you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes,&quot; she said, with an inward catching of her breath--&quot;yes,
your communications with me.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Let it be this way. If you do not hear from me at the end of
every forty-eight hours, then begin to think that things may be going wrong with
me; while if, at the end of a second forty-eight hours, you have still heard
nothing from me, well! consider that they have gone very wrong indeed. Shall it
be like that?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Oh!&quot; the girl exclaimed with almost a gasp, &quot;I am appalled.
Appalled even at the thought that such an arrangement, such precautions, should
have to be made.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Of course, they may not be necessary,&quot; he said; &quot;after all,
we may be misjudging Sebastian.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;We are not,&quot; she answered emphatically. &quot;I feel it; I know
it. I mistrust that man--I have always disliked him. I feel as sure as it is
possible to be that he meditates harm to you. And--and--&quot; she almost sobbed,
&quot;what is to be done if the second forty-eight hours have passed, and still I
have heard nothing from or of you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Then,&quot; he said with a light laugh--&quot;then I think I should
warn some of those gentry whom we have seen loafing about Belize in a light and
tasteful uniform--the constabulary, aren't they?--that a little visit to
Desolada might be useful.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Oh!&quot; Beatrix cried again now, &quot;don't make a joke of it, Mr.
Ritherdon! Don't, pray don't. You cannot understand how I feel, nor what my
fears are. If four days went by and I heard no tidings of you, I should begin to
think that--that----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No,&quot; he said, interrupting her. &quot;No. Don't think that!
Whatever Sebastian may suspect me of knowing, he would not do what you imagine.
He would not----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Kill you, you would say! Why, then, should he mount you on
that horse? And--and was--there no intention of killing you when the coral snake
was found in your bed--a deadly, venomous reptile, whose bite is always fatal
within the hour--nor when that shot was fired at you?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Is there not a chance,&quot; Julian said now, asking a question
instead of answering one, &quot;that, after all, we are entirely on a wrong tack,
granting even that Sebastian is in a false position--a position that by right is
mine?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What can you mean? How can we be on a false tack?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;In this way. Even should it be as I suggest, namely, that he
is--well, the wrong man, how is it possible that he should be aware of it; above
all, how is it possible that he should know that I am aware of it? He has been
at Desolada, and held the position of heir to--to--to my father ever since he
was a boy, a baby. If wrong has been done, he was not and could not be the doer
of it. Therefore, why should he suspect me of being the right man, and
consequently wish to injure me?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Surely the answer is clear enough,&quot; Beatrix replied. &quot;However
innocent he may once have been of all knowledge of a wrong having been done, he
possesses that knowledge now--in some way. And,&quot; the girl went on, turning her
face towards him as she spoke, so that he could see her features plainly in the
starlight, &quot;he knows that it is to you it has been done. Would not that suffice
to make him meditate harm to you?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yet, granting this, how--how can it be? How can he have
discovered the wrongdoing. A wrongdoing that his father--his supposed
father--died without suspecting.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, that is it; that is what puzzles me more than all else,&quot;
Beatrix exclaimed, &quot;that Mr. Ritherdon should have died without suspecting.'
That is it. It is indeed marvellous that he could have been imposed upon from
first to last.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Then for a time they rode on in silence, each deep in their
own thoughts: a silence broken at last by Beatrix saying--</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Whatever the secret is, I am convinced that one other person
knows it besides himself.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Madame Carmaux?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, Madame Carmaux. If we could find out what her influence
over him is, or rather what makes her so strong an ally of his, then I feel sure
that all would be as clear as day.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">These conversations caused Julian ample food for meditation as
he rode back towards Desolada in the coolness of the dawn--a roseate and
primrose hued dawn--after having left Beatrix Spranger at her father's house.</p>

<p class="normal">What was Madame Carmaux's influence over Sebastian? Why was
she so strong an ally of his? And for answer to his self-communings, he could
find only one. The answer that this woman, who had been bereft in one short year
of the husband she had hurriedly espoused in her bitterness of desolation as
well as of the little infant daughter who had come as a solace to her misery,
had transferred all the affection left in her heart to the boy she found at
Desolada; no matter whom that boy might be.</p>

<p class="normal">An affection that year following year had caused to ripen
until, at last, her very existence had become bound up in his. This, combined
with the fact that Desolada had been her home, and that home a comfortable one,
over which she had ruled as mistress for so many years, was the only answer he
could find.</p>

<p class="normal">All was very still as he rode into the back part of the
mansion where the stables were--for it was now but little after four o'clock,
and consequently there was hardly daylight yet--when, unsaddling the mustang
himself, he closed the stable door again and prepared to make his way into the
house. This was easy enough to do, since, in such a climate, windows were never
closed at night, and, beyond the persianas, which could easily be lifted aside,
there was no bar to any one's entrance.</p>

<p class="normal">Yet early as it was or, as it should be said, perhaps, far
advanced as the night was, Sebastian had not yet sought his bed. Instead, he
seemed to have decided on taking whatever rest he might require in the great
saloon in which he seemed to pass the principal part of his time when at home.
He was asleep now in the large Singapore chair he always sat in--it being inside
the room at this time instead of outside on the veranda--possibly for fear of
any night dews that--even in this climate--will sometimes arise; he being near
the table on which was the never-failing bottle of Bourbon whisky. &quot;The young
man's companion,&quot; as Sebastian had more than once hilariously termed it.</p>

<p class="normal">But that was not the only bottle, the only liquid, on the
table by his side.</p>

<p class="normal">For there stood also by Sebastian's hand a stumpy, neckless
bottle which looked as if it might once have been part of the stock-in-trade of
some chemist's shop--a bottle which was half full of a liquid of the faintest
amber or hay-colour. And, to his astonishment, he likewise saw standing on the
table a small retort, a thing he had never supposed was likely to be known to
Sebastian.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Well!&quot; he thought to himself as he moved slowly along the
balcony to the open door, not being desirous of waking the sleeping man, &quot;you
are indeed a strange man, if 'strange' is the word to apply to you. I wonder
what you are dabbling in chemistry for now? Probably no good!&quot;</p>

<h4><a name="div1_21" href="#div1Ref_21">CHAPTER XXI.</a></h4>

<h5>JULIAN FEELS STRANGE</h5>
<br>

<p class="normal">A fortnight had elapsed, it has been
written, since the meeting between Beatrix and Julian on the palm-clad knoll,
and during that time the latter had found himself left very much to his own
resources by Sebastian. Indeed, Julian was never quite able to make out what
became of his &quot;relative&quot; during the day, although at night, when they sat as
usual on the veranda, Sebastian generally explained matters by saying that he
had been absent at one place or another on business, the &quot;business&quot; consisting
of trafficking with other settlers for the sale or purchase of the productions
of the various estates. As, however, few people ever came to Desolada, and none
as &quot;visitors&quot; in the ordinary sense of the word, Julian had no opportunity of
discovering by outside conversation whether the other's statements were accurate
or not. Still, as he said to himself, Sebastian's pursuits were no concern
whatever of his, and at any rate the latter's absence left him free to do
whatever he chose with his own time. To shoot curassows, wild turkeys, and
sometimes monkeys, or, at least, to appear to go out shooting them; though, as
often as not, the expedition ended at All Pines, to which place Julian made his
way every other day to post a letter to Beatrix.</p>

<p class="normal">Now, after a fortnight had been spent in this manner, during
the whole of which period he had not set his eyes on Madame Carmaux, who still
kept her room and was reported to be suffering from a bilious fever, the two men
sat upon the veranda of the lower floor after the evening meal had been
concluded, both of them having their pipes in their mouths. While, close to
Sebastian's hand, was a large tumbler which contained a very good modicum of
Bourbon whisky, slightly dashed with water.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You don't drink at all now,&quot; that gentleman said to his
cousin, as he always called him. &quot;Don't you like the stuff, or what? If that's
what it is, I can get something else, you know, from Belize.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No,&quot; Julian replied, &quot;that is not what it is. But of late,
for a week or so now, I have not been feeling well, and perhaps abstinence from
that is the best thing,&quot; and he nodded his head towards where the Bourbon whisky
bottle stood.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I told you so,&quot; Sebastian exclaimed; &quot;only you wouldn't
believe me. You were sure to feel seedy sooner or later. Every one does at
first, when they come to this precious colony.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I ought to be pretty well climate-hardened all the same,&quot;
Julian remarked, &quot;after the places I've been in. Burmah isn't considered quite
the sweetest thing in the way of health resorts, yet I got through that all
right.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I hope you are not going to have a fever or anything wrong
with your liver. Those are the things people suffer from here, intermittent and
remittent fevers especially. I must give you some medicine.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No, thanks,&quot; Julian replied; &quot;I think I can do very well
without it at present. Besides, the time has come for me to bring my visit to a
close, you know. You have been very kind and hospitable, but there is such a
thing as overstaying one's welcome.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">To his momentary astonishment, since he quite expected that
Sebastian was looking forward to his departure with considerable eagerness and
was extremely desirous of seeing the last of him, this announcement was not
received at all as he expected. In actual truth, Julian had imagined that his
decision would be accepted with the faintest of protests which a host could
make, while, instead, he perceived that Sebastian was absolutely overcome with
something that, if not dismay, was very like it. His face fell, as the light of
the lamp (round which countless moths buzzed and circled in the sickly night
air) testified plainly, and he uttered an exclamation that was one of unfeigned
disappointment, if not regret.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Oh!&quot; he said, &quot;but I can't allow that. I can't, indeed. Going
away because you feel queer. Nonsense, man! You'll be all right in a day or so.
And to go away after a visit of two or three weeks only! Why! when people come
such a journey as you have done from England to here, we expect them to stop six
months.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;That in any case would be impossible. My leave of absence
only covers that space of time, and cannot be exceeded. But,&quot; Julian continued,
&quot;don't think, all the same, that I am afraid of fever or anything of that sort.
That wouldn't frighten me away.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I can't see what you came for, then. What the deuce,&quot; he
said, speaking roughly now as though his temper was rising, &quot;could have brought
you to Honduras if you weren't going to stay above a month in the place?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I wanted to see the place where my father lived,&quot; the other
replied, and as he did so he watched Sebastian's features carefully. For
although, of course, he was supposed to be the son of George Ritherdon who had
lived at Desolada once, he thought it most probable that this remark might cause
his cousin some disturbance.</p>

<p class="normal">Whether it did so or not, he could, however, scarcely tell,
since, as he made it, Sebastian, who was relighting his pipe with a match, let
the latter fall, and instantly leant forward to pick it up again.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Oh!&quot; he exclaimed, when he had done so, &quot;of course, if you
only wanted to do that, two or three weeks are long enough. Yet, I must say, I
think it is an uncommon short stay. However, I suppose even now you don't mean
to go off in a wonderful hurry?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;To-day,&quot; said Julian, &quot;is Wednesday. Suppose, as you are so
kind, that we fix next Monday for my departure.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Next Monday. Next Monday,&quot; and by the movement of Sebastian's
lips, the other could see that he was making some kind of calculation. &quot;Next
Monday. Four clear days. Ah!&quot; and his face brightened very much as he spoke.
&quot;Well! that's something, isn't it? Four clear days.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Upstairs, when Julian had reached his room, he found himself
meditating upon why Sebastian should have seemed so undoubtedly pleased at the
knowledge that he was going to stay for another &quot;four clear days.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;We haven't seen such a wonderful lot of each other,&quot; he
reflected, &quot;except for an hour or so after supper; and as I have spent my time
uselessly in mooning about this place and the neighbourhood, he can't suppose
that it's very lively for me. Especially as--as there have been risks.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;As--as--as there have been--risks,&quot; he repeated a few moments
afterwards. Then, while still he sat on in his chair, gazing, as he recognised,
vaguely out of the window, he noticed that his mind seemed to have got into a
dull, sodden state--that it was not active.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;As--there--have--been risks,&quot; he repeated once more. And now
he pushed his chair on one side as he rose from it, exclaiming:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;This won't do. There's something wrong with me.
As--there--have--no!--no! I don't want to keep on repeating this phrase over and
over again. What is the matter with me? <i>Have</i> I got a fever?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Thinking this, though as he did so he recognised that his head
was by no means clear and that he felt dull and heavy, as a man might do who had
not slept for some nights, he thought, too, that it would be best for him to go
to bed. Doubtless his liver was affected by the climate; doubtless, also, he
would be well enough in the morning.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;There is,&quot; he said to himself, &quot;a chemist's in the village of
All Pines--I will let him to give me a draught in the morning. I wonder if Zara
ever takes a draught--I--I--mean Beatrix. What rot I am talking!&quot; he murmured to
himself, &quot;and now, to add to other things the lamp is going out.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Whereon he made a step towards where the lamp stood on the
table, and turning up the wicks gently saw that, in a moment, the flames were
leaping up the glass chimney and blackening it.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I thought it was going out,&quot; he said to himself, turning the
wicks down again rapidly; &quot;I seem to be getting blind too. There is no doubt
that I have got a fever. Let me see.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">As he spoke he put his hand into his trousers pocket to draw
out his keys, it being his intention to open his Gladstone bag and get out a
little medicine casket he always carried with him when out of England, and
especially when in tropical places; and, in doing so, he leant his head a little
to the side that the pocket was on, his chin drooping somewhat towards the lapel
of his white jacket.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I suppose,&quot; he muttered, &quot;that my sense of smell's affected
too, now. Or else--jacket's getting--some beastly old--old--old tropical smell
that clings to everything--in--in such countries. Never mind. Here's keys.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He drew them forth, regarding the bunch with a stare as though
it was something he was unacquainted with, and then, instead of putting into the
lock of the bag the long slim key which is usual, he endeavoured to insert a
large one that really belonged to a trunk he had left behind at the shipping
office in Belize as not being wanted.</p>

<p class="normal">Reflection served, however, to call to his mind that this key
was not very likely to open the bag, and at last, after giving an inane smile at
the mistake, he succeeded in his endeavour and was able to get out the contents,
and to withdraw the little medicine casket.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Quinine,&quot; he said, spelling the word letter by letter as he
held the phial under the lamp. &quot;Quinine. That's it. Don't let's make a mistake.
Q-u-i-n-i-n-e. That's all right. Can't go wrong now.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">By the aid of the contents of the water-bottle and his glass
he was enabled to swallow two quinine pills of two grains each, and then he
resolved--in a hazy, uncertain kind of way--to go to bed. Whereon, slowly he
divested himself of his clothes and, in a mechanical manner, threw back the
mosquito curtains. But, whatever might be the matter with him, and however
clouded his intellect might be, he was not yet so dense as to forget the strange
occupant of that bed which he had once before discovered there.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Beatrix said,&quot; he muttered, &quot;that coral snake kills in an
hour. I don't want to die in an hour. Let's see if we've got another guest here
to-night.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">And, as he had done every night since he had returned to
Desolada, he thoroughly explored the bed, doing so, however, on this occasion in
a lethargic, heavy manner which caused him to be some considerable time about
it.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Turn to the left to unscrew,&quot; he said to himself, recalling
some old schoolboy phrase as he stood now by the lamp ready to extinguish it,
&quot;to the right to screw. Same, I suppose, to turn up and down. Oh! the revolver.
Where's that? May as well have it handy.&quot; Whereupon he went over to where he had
hung up his jacket and removed the weapon from the inside pocket.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;A nasty smell these tropical places have,&quot; he muttered as he
did so. &quot;There's the smell of India--no one ever forgets that--and also the
smell of Africa. Well! strikes me Honduras can go one better than either of
them.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Then he got into bed.</p>

<p class="normal">Dizzy, stupefied as he felt, however, it did not seem as if
his stupefaction or semi-delirium, or whatever it was which had overcome him,
was likely to plunge him into a heavy, dull sleep. Instead, he found himself
lying there with his eyes wide open, and, although his brain felt like a lump of
lead, while there was a weight at his forehead as if something were pressing on
it, he was conscious that one of his senses was very acute--namely, the sense of
smell. Either that, or else some very peculiar phase in the fever which he was
experiencing, was causing a strange sense of disgust in his nostrils.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;This bed smells just like a temple I went into in Burmah
once,&quot; he thought to himself. &quot;What the deuce is the matter with me--or it?
Anyhow, I can't stand it.&quot; And, determined not to endure the unpleasantness any
longer, he got up from the bed, while wrapping himself in the dark coverlet he
went over to an old rickety sofa that ran along the opposite side of the room
and lay down upon it.</p>

<p class="normal">And here, at least, the odour was not apparent. The old
horsehair bolster and pillow did emit, it is true, the peculiar stuffy flavour
which such things will do even in temperate climates; but beyond that nothing
else. The acrid, loathsome odour which he had smelt for the first time when he
leant his head slightly as he felt for his keys, and which he had perceived in a
far more intensified form when he lay down in the bed, was not at all apparent
now. It seemed as if he was, at last, likely to fall asleep.</p>

<h5>IN THE DARK</h5>
<br>

<p class="normal">Julian supposed when he was awakened later
on, and felt that he was drenched with a warm perspiration which caused his
light tropical clothes to stick to him with a hot clammy feeling, that he must
have slept for two hours. For now, as he lay on the sofa facing the window, he
could see through the slats of the persianas, which he had forgotten to turn
down, that, peeping round the window-frame there came an edge of the moon, which
he seemed to recollect--dimly, hazily, and indistinctly--had risen late last
night.</p>

<p class="normal">And that moon--which stole more and more into his view as he
regarded it--was casting now a long ray into the bedroom, so that there came
across the floor a streak of light of about the breadth of nine inches.</p>

<p class="normal">Yet--once his bemused brain had grasped the fact that this ray
was there, while, at the same time, that brain was still clear enough to
comprehend that every moment the flood of light was becoming larger, so that
soon the apartment would be filled with it--he paid no further attention to the
matter, nor to the distant rumbling of thunder far away--thunder that told of a
tropical storm taking place at a distance. Instead, he was endeavouring to argue
silently with himself as to the actual state in which his mind was; as to
whether he was in a dreamy kind of delirium, or whether, in spite of any fever
that might be upon him, he was still able to distinctly understand his
surroundings.</p>

<p class="normal">If, as he hoped earnestly, the latter was the case; if he was
not delirious, but only numbed by some ailment that had insidiously taken
possession of him--then--why then--surely! he was in deadly peril of some
immediate attack upon him--upon his life perhaps.</p>

<p class="normal">For, outside those persianas there was another light, two
other lights glittering in upon him that were not cast by the moon, but that
(because now and again her rays were thrown upon them) he discovered to be a
pair of eyes. And not the eyes of an animal either, since they glisten in the
dark, but, instead, human eyes that glared horribly as now and again the
moonbeams caught them.</p>

<p class="normal">Only! was it the truth that they were real tangible eyes, or
were they but a fantasy of a mind unhinged by fever?</p>

<p class="normal">He must know that! And he could only do so by lying perfectly
still; by watching.</p>

<p class="normal">Those eyes which stared in at him now were low down to the
floor of the balcony, even as he seemed to recollect Zara's eyes had been on one
occasion during her nocturnal visits to him when he first arrived at Desolada;
yet now he knew, felt sure, that they were not Zara's. Why he felt so sure he
could not tell, nor in the feverish languor that was upon him, could he even
reason with himself as why he did feel so sure. But, at the same time, he told
himself, they were not hers. Of that he was certain.</p>

<p class="normal">How did they come there, low down--not a foot above the floor
of the veranda? Could they indeed be the eyes of an animal in spite of the white
eyeballs on which the rays shone with such a sickly gleam; did they belong to
some household dog which had chosen this spot for its night's repose?
Yet--yet--if such was the case, why did it not sleep curled up or stretched out,
instead of peering through the latticework with its eyes close to the slats, as
though determined to see all that was in the room and all that was going on in
it. No! it could not be that, while, also it was not what he had deemed it might
be a few minutes ago--the eyes of a snake. It was impossible, since the eyes of
a snake would have been much closer together.</p>

<p class="normal">They were--there could be no doubt about it! the eyes of a
human being, man or woman. And they were not Zara's. He was sure of that.</p>

<p class="normal">But still they glared into the room, glared through the dusky
sombreness of the lower part of it, of that part of the floor which, even now,
the moonlight was not illuminating. And then to his astonishment he saw, as the
light flooded the apartment more and more, that those eyes were staring not at
him but towards another portion of the room; towards where the bed stood
enveloped in the long hanging folds of the mosquito curtains, which, to his
distempered mind, seemed in the weird light of the tropical night to look like
the hangings that enshroud a catafalque--a funeral canopy.</p>

<p class="normal">His hand, shaky though he knew it was from whatever ailed him,
was on his revolver; for a moment or so he lay there asking himself if he should
fire at that wizard thing, that creepy mystery outside his room; if he should
aim fair between those glistening eyeballs and trust to fortune to kill or
disable the mysterious watcher? But still, however, he refrained; for, if his
senses were still in his own possession, if his mind was still able to
understand anything, it understood that near the bed in which he should have
been sleeping had it not been for the evil odours exhaled from it to-night,
there was something that might be a more fitting object of his discharge than
the creature outside.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;If,&quot; he thought to himself, &quot;I am neither mad nor delirious
nor drenched with fever, those eyes are watching something in this room, and
that something is not myself.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Should he turn his head; could he turn it towards that dark
patch behind the mosquito curtains which was not illuminated with the moon's
rays? Could he do it as a man turns in his sleep--restlessly--so that in the
action there might be nothing which should alarm whatever lurked in the darkness
over there; the thing that, having got into his room in the night full of evil
intentions towards him, was now itself being watched, suspected, perhaps
trapped. Could he do it?</p>

<p class="normal">As he meditated thus, feeling sure now that his stupor, his
density of mind, was not what it had been--recognising with a feeling of devout
thankfulness that, whatever his state might hitherto have been, his mind was now
becoming clear and his intellect collected, he prepared to put this
determination into practise. He would roll over on to his right side, as he had
seen sleepy sailors roll over on to theirs in the watch below; he would roll
over too, with his hand securely on the butt of his revolver. And then--if--if,
as he felt certain was the case, there was some dark skulking thing hiding
behind his bedhead, if he should see another pair of eyes gleaming out in the
rays of the moon--why, then, woe befall it! He had had enough of these midnight
hauntings from one visitant or another in this house of mystery; he would fire
straight at that figure, he would kill it dead, if so it must be, even if it
were Sebastian himself.</p>

<p class="normal">As he turned, imitating a sleeper's restlessness, as well as
he was able, there came two interruptions--interruptions that stayed his hand.</p>

<p class="normal">From near the bed--he was right! those eyes outside had been
watching something that was inside there!--close to him, across the room, he
heard a sound. A sound that was half a one, half an inward catching of the
breath, a gasp. Yet so low, so quickly suppressed, that none who had not
suspected, none who had not been on the watch for the slightest sign, would have
heard or noticed it. But he had heard it!</p>

<p class="normal">The other was a noisier, a more palpable interruption.
Sebastian, below in the great saloon on the front was singing to himself, loudly
and boisterously, and then, equally boisterously, was wishing Madame Carmaux
&quot;Good-night.&quot; Answering evidently, too, some question, which Julian could not
hear put to him by her, and expressing also the hope that she would feel better
soon.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yet,&quot; thought Julian, &quot;she cannot quit her room. It is
strange. Strange, too, that she should be up so late. It must be two o'clock, at
least.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">With a glance from his eye towards the lower part of the
window, which still he could see from the position in which he lay, he observed
that the mysterious watcher outside was gone. Those eyes, at least, no longer
gleamed from low down by the floor; through the slats of the blind he perceived
that the spot where they had lately been was now a void. The watcher was gone!
But what of the one who had been watched, of the lurking creature that was near
his bed, and that had gasped with fear even as he turned over on the sofa? What
of that? Well, it was still there. He was alone with it.</p>

<p class="normal">His thumb drew back the trigger of the revolver, the
well-known click was heard--the click which can never be disguised or silenced.
A click that many a man has listened to with mortal agony and terror of soul,
knowing that it sounds his knell. Then again on his ears there fell that gasp,
that indrawn catching of the breath, which told of a terrified object close by
his side.</p>

<p class="normal">And it could not be Sebastian who had uttered it; Sebastian,
the one person alone who had reason to meditate the worst towards him that one
human being can desire for another. It could not be he. For was he not still
singing boisterously below in the front of the house? It could not be he. And,
Julian reflected, he was about to take a life, the life of some one whom he
himself did not know, of some one whose presence in his room even at night, at
such an hour of the night, might yet be capable of explanation; that might not,
in absolute fact, bode evil to him. Suppose, that after all, it should be Zara,
and that again she was there for some purpose of serving his interest as he had
told Beatrix he believed she had been more than once before. Suppose that, and
that now he should fire and kill her! How would he feel then! What would his
remorse be?</p>

<p class="normal">No! He would not do it.</p>

<p class="normal">Instead, therefore, he whispered the words, &quot;Zara, what is
it?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Even as he did so, even as he spoke, he noticed that a change
had come over the room. It was quite dark now; the moon's rays no longer gleamed
in; the moon itself was gone, obscured. What had happened? In a moment the
question was answered.</p>

<p class="normal">Upon the balcony outside there came a rattle as though a
deluge of small stones had been hurled down upon it, and he, who knew well what
the violence of tropical storms is, recognized that one had broken over
Desolada, and that the rain, if not hail, was descending in a deluge. A moment
later there came, too, a flash of purple, gleaming lightning which was gone
before he could turn his eyes into the quarter of the room where lurked the
thing that he suspected, felt sure was there. Then, over all, there burst the
roar of the thunder from above, reverberating, pealing all around, rumbling, and
reechoing a moment later in the Cockscomb Mountains.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Zara!&quot; he called louder now, so as to make himself heard
above the din of the storm--&quot;Zara, why do you not answer me? I mean you no
harm.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">But, if amid this tumult any answer was given, he did not hear
it. For now the crash of the thunder, the downpour of the rain, the screaming of
the parrots, and the demoniacal howlings of the baboons farther away, served to
create such a turmoil that scarcely could the cry of a human voice be heard
above it all.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I am determined,&quot; Julian exclaimed, &quot;to know who and what it
is that cowers there!&quot; Wherewith he sprang from off the sofa on which he had
previously raised himself to a sitting position, and, with a leap, rushed
towards the mosquito curtains hanging by the bedhead. &quot;I will see who and what
you are!&quot; he cried, feeling certain that in this spot was still lurking some
strange, secret visitant.</p>

<p class="normal">Yet to his astonishment the spot was empty when he reached it.
Neither human being nor animal, nor anything whatever, was there.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I am indeed struck with fever and delirious,&quot; he muttered to
himself, &quot;or if not that, am mad. Yet I could have sworn it was as I thought.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Then again, as he stood there holding in his hand the gauzy
curtains which he had brushed aside, the storm burst afresh over the house with
renewed violence; again the sheets of rain poured down; once more the purple
tropical lightning flashed and the thunder roared. And as the tempest beat down
on all beneath its violence, and while a moment of intense darkness was followed
by an instant of brilliant light, Julian heard a stronger rattle of the Venetian
blinds than the wind had made, and saw, as again there came a flash of
lightning, a dark, hooded figure creep out swiftly past them on to the
balcony--a figure shrouded to the eyes, yet in the dark eyes of which, as the
lightning played on them, there seemed to be a look of awful fear.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="div1_23" href="#div1Ref_23">CHAPTER XXIII.</a></h4>

<h5>WARNED</h5>
<br>

<p class="normal">Blue as the deepest gleam within the
sapphire's depth were the heavens; bright as molten gold were the sun's rays the
next morning when the storm was past--leaving, however, in its track some marks
of its passage. For the flowers in the gardens round the house were beaten down
now with the weight of water that had fallen on them; beneath the oleanders and
the flamboyants, the allamandas and ixoras, the blossoms strewed the pampas
grass in masses; while many crabs--which wander up from the seacoast in search
of succulent plants whereon to feed--lay dead near the roots of the bushes and
shrubs.</p>

<p class="normal">Yet a day's scorching sun, to be followed perhaps by an entire
absence of further rain for a month, would soon cause fresh masses of bloom to
take the place of those which were destroyed, especially as now they had
received the moisture so necessary to their existence. And Julian, standing on
his balcony and wondering who that strange nocturnal visitor was who had fled on
to this very balcony a few hours before, thought that during his stay in this
mysterious place he had never seen its surroundings look so fair.</p>

<p class="normal">Whether it was that he had received considerable benefit from
the quinine which he had taken overnight, or whether it was from the total
change of clothing which he had now assumed in place of the garments he had worn
up to now, or perhaps from his not having lain through the night upon the bed
which, particularly of late, had seemed so malodorous, he felt very much better
this morning. His brain no longer appeared numbed nor his mind hazy, nor had he
any headache.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Which,&quot; he said to himself, &quot;is a mighty good thing. For now
I want all my wits about me. This affair has got to be brought to a conclusion
somehow, and Julian Ritherdon is the man to do it. Only,&quot; he said, with now a
smile on his face--&quot;only, no more of the simple trusting individual you have
been, my friend--if you ever have been such! Instead of suspecting Master
Sebastian of being in the wrong box you have got to prove him so, and instead of
suspecting him to be a--well! say a gentleman who hasn't got much regard for
you, you have got to get to windward of him. Now go full speed ahead, my son.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Whereon, to commence the process of getting to windward of
Sebastian and also of carrying out the movement known in his profession as going
&quot;full speed ahead,&quot; he informed the nigger who brought him his shaving-water
that he felt very poorly indeed, and would, with Sebastian's permission, remain
in his room that day.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Because,&quot; he said to himself, &quot;I think it would be as well if
I kept a kind of watch upon this tastefully furnished apartment. Like all the
rest of this house, it is becoming what the conjurers call 'a home of mystery,'
and is consequently getting more and more interesting. And there are only the
'four clear days' left wherein the mystery can be solved--if ever.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">A few moments after he had made these reflections he heard a
tap at his bedroom door, and on bidding the person who was outside to come in,
Sebastian made his appearance, there being on his face a look of regret at the
information which he said the negro had just conveyed to him.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I say, old fellow, this is bad news. It won't do at all. Not
at all. What is the matter with you?&quot; he exclaimed in his usual bluff, hearty
way.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;A touch of fever, I'm afraid,&quot; Julian replied. &quot;Not much, I
fancy, but still worth being careful about. I'll keep my room to-day if you
don't mind.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Mind!&quot; Sebastian exclaimed. &quot;Mind; why, my dear Julian,
that's the very best thing you can do, the very thing you ought to do. And I'll
send you something appetizing by Zara. Let me see. They have brought in this
morning some of that mountain mullet you liked so much; that will do first-rate
for breakfast with some Guava jelly. How will that suit?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Nothing could be better. Those mountain mullet are superb.
You are very good.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Oh! that's nothing. And, look here, I have brought you a
little phial of our physic-nut oil, which the natives say will cure anything,
and almost bring a dead man back to life. Take three or four drops of that, my
boy, in your coffee, and you'll feel a new man,&quot; whereon he drew a little phial
from his pocket and stood it on the table. Then, after a few more sympathetic
remarks he prepared to depart, saying he would have the breakfast prepared and
sent up by Zara at once.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I was glad,&quot; Julian said casually, as Sebastian approached
the door, &quot;to hear you wishing Madame Carmaux good-night, last night. I didn't
know she was well enough to get downstairs yet.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Oh! yes,&quot; the other replied in a more or less careless tone,
&quot;she came down to supper last night and sat up late with me. I was glad of her
company, you know. So you heard us, eh? Did you hear us singing, too? We got
quite inspirited over her return to health. If you'd only been down, my boy, we
would have had a rollicking time of it.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Never mind,&quot; said Julian, &quot;better luck next time. You wait
till I do come down and we'll have a regular chorus. When I give you some of my
wardroom songs, you'll be surprised.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Right,&quot; said Sebastian, with a laugh; &quot;the sooner the
better,&quot; whereon he took himself off.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I didn't hear the silvery tones of Madame Carmaux, all the
same,&quot; Julian thought to himself after the other was gone, &quot;neither do I
remember that I heard her return his 'good-night.' However, Sebastian's own
tones are somewhat stentorian when he lets himself go, or as our Irish doctor
used to say of the bo'sun's, 'enough to split a pitcher,' so I suppose that
isn't very strange.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He took down his jacket now, and indeed the whole of his white
drill suit which he had discarded for an exactly similar one that he had in his
large Gladstone bag, and began to roll it up preparatory to packing it away.
Though, as he did so, he again perceived the horrible f&#339;tid odour which it
had emitted overnight--the same odour that had also been so perceptible when he
had laid his head upon the pillow. The revolting smell that had driven him from
the bed to seek repose on that sofa.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Faugh!&quot; he exclaimed, &quot;it is loathsome. Even now, with the
room full of the fresh morning air, I feel as if I were getting giddy and
bemused again.&quot; Whereon, and while uttering some remarks that were by no means
complimentary to Honduras and some of its perfumes, he began rolling the clothes
up as quickly as he could. Yet while he did so, being now engaged with the
jacket, his eye was attracted by the lapel of the collar, the white surface of
which was discoloured--though only in the faintest degree discoloured--a
yellowish, grey colour. Each lapel, down to where the topmost button was! Then,
after a close inspection of the jacket all over, he perceived that nowhere else
was it similarly stained.</p>

<p class="normal">His curiosity becoming excited by this, since in no way could
he account for such a thing (he distinctly remembered that there had been no
stain, however faint, on the lapel before), he regarded the waistcoat next; and
there, on the small lapel of that--both left and right--were the same marks.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Strange,&quot; he muttered, &quot;strange. Very strange. One might say
that the washerwoman had spilt something on coat and waistcoat--purposely.
Something, too, that smells uncommonly nasty.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">For, by inspection, or rather test with his nostrils, he was
easily able to perceive that no other part of his discarded clothing emitted any
such disagreeable odour. While, too, as he applied his nose again and again to
the faint stains, he also perceived that in his brain there came once more the
giddiness and haziness from which he had suffered so much last night--as well as
the feeling of stupid density amounting almost to dreaminess or delirium.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;If that stuff was under my nose all day long yesterday, and
perhaps for a week or so before,&quot; he reflected, &quot;I don't wonder that at last I
became almost wandering in my mind, as well as stupefied.&quot; Then, a thought
striking him, he went over to the pillow on the bed and gazed down on it. And
there, upon it, on either side, was the same stain--faint, yellow, and emitting
the same acrid, loathsome odour.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;So, so,&quot; he said to himself, &quot;I begin to understand. I begin
to understand very well, and to comprehend Sebastian's chemical experiments. The
woman who washed my jacket and waistcoat in England is not the same woman who
washed that pillow-case in British Honduras. Yet the same stain and the same
odour are on both. All right! A good deal may happen in the next four days.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Then, as he thus meditated, he opened the little phial of
physic-nut oil, which Sebastian had thoughtfully brought him and left behind
with injunctions that he should take three or four drops of it in his coffee,
and smelt it. After which he said, &quot;Certainly, I won't fail to do so. All right,
Sebastian, it's full speed ahead now!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">A little later, Zara arrived bearing in her hands a large tray
on which were all the necessaries for a breakfast that would have satisfied a
hungry man, let alone an &quot;invalid.&quot; There were, of course, innumerable other
servants about this vast house, but Zara always seemed to perform the principal
duties of waiting upon those who constituted the superiors, and in many cases to
issue orders to the others, in much such a way as a butler in England issues
orders to his underlings.</p>

<p class="normal">Now, having deposited the tray upon the table, which she
cleared for the purpose, she uncovered the largest dish and submitted to
Julian's gaze a good-sized trout reposing in it and looking extremely
appetizing.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;But,&quot; said Julian, as he regarded the fish, &quot;that isn't what
Sebastian promised me. He said he would send one of those delicious mountain
mullet we had the other night.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">For a moment the half-caste girl's lustrous eyes dwelt almost
meditatively, as it seemed, on him; then she said, &quot;There are none. The men have
not caught any for a long time.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;But Mr. Ritherdon said there were. That the men----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He was wrong,&quot; she interrupted, her eyes roaming all round
the room, while it seemed almost to Julian as though, particularly, they sought
the spot where the pillow was. &quot;He was wrong. You eat that,&quot; looking at the
dish. &quot;That will do you no--will do you good.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">And it appeared to Julian, now thoroughly on the <i>qui vive</i>
as to everything that went on around him as well as to every word that was
uttered, as though she emphasized the word &quot;that.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I'm glad to hear Madame Carmaux is so much better,&quot; he said,
conversationally, as she finished arranging the breakfast before him and poured
out his coffee. &quot;They were pretty gay below last night.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Below last night,&quot; she repeated, her eyes full on him. &quot;Below
last night. Were they? Did you hear her below last night?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Didn't you?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I was not there,&quot; she answered; &quot;I was nursing a sick woman
in the plantation.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Oh! You didn't pass your evening on the balcony, then, as you
have sometimes done?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No,&quot; she said, and still her eyes gazed so intently into his
that he wondered what was going on in her mind.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No.&quot; Then, suddenly, she asked, &quot;When are you going away?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;That is not polite, Zara. One never asks a guest----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Why,&quot; she interrupted, speaking almost savagely and showing
her small white teeth, as though with an access of sudden temper--&quot;why do you
turn everything into a--a--<i>chanza</i>--a joke. Are you a fo--a madman?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Really, Zara!&quot; Then, seeing that the girl was contending with
some inward turbulence of spirit which seemed almost likely to end in an
outbreak, Julian said quietly, seriously, &quot;No, Zara, I am neither a fool nor a
madman. Look here, I believe you are a good, honest, straightforward girl.
Therefore, I will be plain with you. I have told Mr. Ritherdon that I am going
on Monday. In four days----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Go at once!&quot; she interrupted again. &quot;At once. Get news from
Belize, somehow, that calls you away. Leave Desolada. Begone!&quot; she continued in
her quaint, stilted English, which she spoke well enough except when obliged to
use either a Spanish or Carib word. &quot;Begone!&quot; And as she said this it seemed
almost to Julian that, with those dark gleaming eyes of hers, she was
endeavouring to convey some intelligence to him which she would not put into
words.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;That,&quot; he said, referring to her last sentence, &quot;is what I am
thinking about doing. Only, even then, I shall not have done with Desolada and
its inhabitants. There is more for me to do yet, Zara.&quot;</p>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<h4><a name="div1_24" href="#div1Ref_24">CHAPTER XXIV.</a></h4>

<h5>JULIAN'S EYES ARE OPENED</h5>
<br>

<p class="normal">Julian's slumbers of the past night having
been more or less disturbed by the various incidents of, first, his drowsy
delirium, then of those figures of the watcher and the watched, as well as by
the storm and the sight of the departing form of the latter individual, he
decided that, during the course of the present day, he would endeavour to obtain
some sleep. Especially he determined thus because, now, he knew that there must
be no more sleeping at night for him.</p>

<p class="normal">Whether he remained in Desolada for the next four nights as he
had consented to do, or whether he decided to follow Zara's suggestion and find
some excuse for departing at once, he understood plainly that to sleep again
when night was over all the house might be fraught with deadly risk to him. What
that risk was, what the tangible shape which it would be likely later on to
assume, he was not yet able to conclude--but that it existed he had no doubt.
Bright and <i>insouciant</i>
as he was, with also in his composition a total absence of fear, he was still
sufficiently cool, as well as sufficiently intelligent to understand that here,
in Desolada, he was not only regarded as an inconvenient interloper, but one who
must be got rid of somehow.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Which proves, if it proves anything,&quot; he thought, &quot;that
Sebastian knows all about why I am in this country; and also that, secure as his
position seems, there is some flaw in it which, if brought to light, will
destroy that position. I know it, too, now, am certain that George Ritherdon's
story is true--and, somehow, I am going to prove it so. I have muddled the time
away too long; now I am going to be a man of action. When I get back to Belize
that action begins. Mr. Spranger said I ought to confide in a lawyer, and in a
lawyer I will confide. Henceforth, we'll thresh this thing out thoroughly.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Zara had come in again and removed the remnants of the
breakfast, and as he had told her that he meant to sleep as long as ever it was
possible, she had promised him that he should not be disturbed. Wherefore, he
now proceeded to darken the room in every way that he could, without thoroughly
excluding the air; namely, by letting down the curtains of the windows as well
as by closing the persianas.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I suppose,&quot; he thought to himself, &quot;there is no likelihood of
my visitor coming in, in the broad daylight, yet, all the same, I will endeavour
to make sure.&quot; Upon which he proceeded to put in practise an old trick which in
his gunroom days he had often played upon his brother middies (and had had
played upon himself); while remembering, as he did so, the merry shouts which
had run along the gangway of the lower deck on dark nights over its successful
accomplishment. He took a piece of stout cord and tied it across from one side
of the window to the other at about a foot and a half from the floor.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Now,&quot; he said, &quot;If any one tries to come in here
to-day--well! if they don't break their legs they'll make such a din as will
lead to their falling into my hands.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">It was almost midday when he laid himself down on the sofa to
obtain his much needed rest--midday, and with the sun streaming down vertically
and making the apartment, in spite of its being darkened, more like the engine
room of a steamer than anything else; yet, soon, he was in a deep refreshing
sleep in spite of this disadvantage. A slumber so calm and refreshing that he
slept on and on, until, at last, the room grew cool; partly by aid of a gentle
breeze which was now blowing down from the summits of the Cockscomb Mountains
and partly by the coming of the swift tropical darkness.</p>

<p class="normal">Then he awoke, not knowing where he was nor being able to
recall that fact even for a moment or so after he was awake, nor to understand
why he lay there in the dark. Yet, as gradually he returned to his every-day
senses, he became aware that he did not alone owe his awakening to the fact that
he had exhausted his desire for slumber, but also to a sound which fell upon his
ears. The sound of a slight tapping on his bedroom door.</p>

<p class="normal">Astonished at the darkness, which now enveloped the room, more
than at anything else--for the tapping he attributed to Zara having brought him
his evening meal--he went to the door and turned the key, he having been careful
to lock the former securely before going to sleep.</p>

<p class="normal">Then, to his surprise, when he had opened the door and peered
into the passage, which was also now enveloped in the shadow of night, he saw a
figure standing there which was not that of Zara, but, instead, of the
half-caste Paz.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What is it?&quot; he asked, staring at the man and wondering what
he wanted. &quot;What! Is anything the matter?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Nothing very much,&quot; the half-caste answered, his eyes having
a strange glitter in them as they rested on Julian's face. &quot;Only, think you like
to see funny sight. You like see Señor Sebastian look very funny. You come with
me. Quietly.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What do you mean, Paz?&quot; Julian asked, wondering if this was
some ruse whereby to beguile him into danger. &quot;What is it?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I show you Massa Sebastian very funny. He very strange. Don't
think he find mountain mullet very good for him; don't think he like drink very
much with physic-nut oil in it,&quot; and he gave that little bleating laugh which
Julian had heard before and marvelled at.</p>

<p class="normal">Mountain mullet! Physic-nut oil! The very things that
Sebastian had suggested to Julian that morning, yet of which Julian had not
partaken. The mullet, although Zara had said the men had not caught any for a
long time. The phial which he had brought to the room, but the oil of which he
had not touched!</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;There was no mountain mullet caught--&quot; he began, but Paz
interrupted him with that bleating laugh once more, though subdued as befitted
the circumstances.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Ho!&quot; he said. &quot;Nice mountain mullet in Desolada this morning.
He order it cook for you. Only--Zara good girl. She love Sebastian, so she give
it him and give you trout. Very good girl. But--it make him funny. So, too,
physic-nut oil. But that wrong name. Physic-nut oil very much. Not good if mixed
with drop of Amancay.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Amancay! Where had Julian heard that name before! Then, swift
as lightning, he remembered. He recalled a conversation he had had with Mr.
Spranger one evening over the various plants and herbs of the colony, and also
how he had listened to stories of the deadly powers of many of them--of the
Manzanillo, or Manchineel, of the Florispondio and the Cojon del gato--above
all, of the Amancay, a plant whose juice caused first delirium; then, if taken
continually, raving madness, and then--death. A plant, too, whose juice could
work its deadly destruction not only by being taken inwardly, but by being
inhaled.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;The Indians,&quot; Mr. Spranger had said, &quot;content themselves with
that. If they can only get the opportunity of sprinkling it on the earth where
their enemy lies, or of smearing his tent canvas with it, or his clothes, the
trick is done. And that enemy's only chance is that he, too, should know of its
properties. Then he is safe. For the odour it emits is such that none who have
ever smelt it once can fail to recognise its presence. But on those who are
unacquainted with those properties--well! God help them!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He wondered as he recalled those words if he had turned white,
so white that, even in the dusk of the corridor, the man standing by his side
could perceive it; he wondered, too, if his features had assumed a stern, set
expression in keeping with the determination that now was dominant in his mind.
The determination to descend to where Sebastian Ritherdon was, to stand face to
face with him, to ask him whether it was he who had sprinkled his jacket and his
waistcoat, as well as the pillow on which he nightly slept, with the accursed,
infernal juice of the deadly Amancay. Ask! Bah! what use to ask, only to receive
a lie in return! What need at all to ask? <i>He knew!</i></p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Come,&quot; he said to Paz, even as he went back into the room for
his revolver. &quot;Come, take me to where this fellow is. Yet,&quot; he said pausing,
&quot;you say I shall see a funny sight. What is it? Is he mad--or dying?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He funny. He eat mountain mullet, he drink physic-nut oil in
wine. Zara love him dearly, he----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Come,&quot; Julian again said, speaking sternly. &quot;Come.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Then they both went along the corridor and down the great
staircase.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Let us go out garden, to veranda,&quot; Paz whispered. &quot;Then we
look in over veranda through open window. See funny things. Hear funny words.&quot;
Whereupon accompanied by Julian, he went out by a side door of the long hall,
and so came around into the garden in front of the great saloon in which
Sebastian always sat in the evening.</p>

<p class="normal">Sheltering themselves behind a vast bush of flamboyants which
grew close up to where the veranda ran, they were both able to see into the
room, when in truth the sight of Sebastian was enough to make the beholders deem
him mad.</p>

<p class="normal">His coat was off, flung across the back of the chair, but in
his hand he had a large white pocket handkerchief with which he incessantly
wiped his face, down which the perspiration was pouring. Yet, even as he did so,
it was plain to observe that he was seeking eagerly for something which he could
not find. A large campeachy-wood cabinet stood up against the wall exactly
facing the spot where the window was, and the doors of this were now set open,
showing all the drawers dragged out of their places and the contents turned out
pell-mell. While the man, lurching unsteadily all the time and with a stumbling,
heavy motion in his feet which seemed familiar enough to Julian (since only last
night he had stumbled and lurched in the same way), was seizing little bottles
and phials and holding them up to the light, and wrenching the corks out of them
to sniff at the contents, and then hurling them away from him with an action of
despair and rage.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He look for counter-poison,&quot; Paz said, using the Spanish
expression, which Julian understood well enough. &quot;Maybe, he not find it. Then he
die,&quot; and the bleating laugh sounded now very much like a gloating chuckle.
&quot;Then he die,&quot; he repeated.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Is there, then, an antidote?&quot; Julian asked.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes. Yes,&quot; Paz whispered. &quot;Yes, antidoty, if he find it. If
he has not taken too much.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;How can he have taken too much? Why take any?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">For answer Paz said nothing, but instead, looked at Julian.
And, in the light that now streamed out across the veranda to where they stood,
dimmed and shaded as it might be by the thick foliage and flower of the
flamboyant bush, the latter could see that the half-caste's eyes glittered
demoniacally and that his fingers were twitching, and judged that it was only by
great constraint that the latter suppressed the laugh he indulged in so often.</p>

<p class="normal">Then, while no word was spoken between them, Julian felt the
long slim fingers of Paz touch his and push something into his hand, something
that he at once recognised to be the phial of physic-nut oil; or, rather, the
phial that had once contained the physic-nut oil, diluted with the juice of the
murderous Amancay.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;All love Sebastian here,&quot; the semi-savage hissed, his
remaining white teeth shining horribly in the flickering gleam through the
flamboyant. &quot;Love him, oh! so dear.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He find it. He find it,&quot; he muttered excitedly an instant
afterwards. &quot;Look! Look! Look!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">And Julian did look; fascinated by Sebastian's manner.</p>

<p class="normal">For the other held now a small bottle in his hand which he had
unearthed from some drawer in the interior of the great cabinet, and was holding
it between his eyes and the globe of the lamp, gazing as steadily as he could at
the mixture which it doubtless contained. As steadily as he could, because he
still swayed about a good deal while he stood there; perhaps because, too, his
hands trembled. Then, with a look of exultation on his features and in his
bloodshot eyes, plainly to be observed from where the two men stood outside, he
tore the stopper out with his teeth, smelt the contents, and instantly seizing a
tumbler emptied them into that, drenched it with water, and drank the draught
down.</p>

<p class="normal">Yet, a moment later, Sebastian performed another action
equally extraordinary--he seeming to remember--as they judged by the look of
dawning recollection on his face--something he had forgotten! He came, still
lurching, a little nearer to the open window, and then in a loud voice--a voice
that was evidently intended to be heard at some distance--said:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Well, good-night, Miriam. Good-night, I am so thankful to
think that you are better! Good night.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">And as he uttered those words, Julian understood.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I see his ruse, his trick,&quot; he muttered. &quot;He thinks that I am
still upstairs, that he is deceiving me, making me believe she is down here.
But, though I am not up there, she is! And perhaps in my room again. Quick, Paz!
Come. Follow me!&quot;</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="div1_25" href="#div1Ref_25">CHAPTER XXV.</a></h4>

<h5>A DÉNOUEMENT</h5>
<br>

<p class="normal">By the same way that they had descended they
now mounted to the floor above. Only, it was not Julian's intention to re-enter
his room in the same manner he had left it; namely, by the door opening out of
the corridor. To do that would be useless, unavailing. If the woman whom he
suspected was in that room now, the first sound of his footstep outside, be it
never so light, would serve to put her on the alert, to cause her to flee out on
to the balcony and away round the whole length of it, and, thereby, with her
knowledge of all the entrances and exits of the house, to evade him.</p>

<p class="normal">That, he reflected, would not do. If she escaped him now, then
the determination he had arrived at, to this night bring matters to a climax,
would be thwarted. Some other way must be found.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Take me on to the veranda,&quot; he whispered to Paz; &quot;to where I
shall be outside the room I occupy. This time I will be the watcher gazing in,
not the person who is watched.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I take you,&quot; Paz said. &quot;I show you. Same way I get there last
night.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Last night! So! That was you outside, lying low down? It was
you?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">But Paz only gave him now that look which he had given before,
while he seemed at the same time to be struggling with that bleating laugh of
his--the laugh which would surely have betrayed his presence.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Come,&quot; he said, &quot;I put you in big room of all. Old man
Ritherdon call it guest room. Sebastian born there.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Was he?&quot; Julian asked in a whisper, &quot;was he? Was he born
there?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He born there. Come.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">So, doubtless, the half-caste believed--since who in all
Honduras disputed it! Who--except Julian himself, and, perhaps, the woman he
loved; perhaps, too, her father.</p>

<p class="normal">Yet, the information that he was now being led to the room in
which he felt sure that it was he who had been born and not the other, filled
him with a kind of mystic, weird feeling as they crept along side by side
towards it. For the first time since he had come to Desolada, he was about to
visit the spot in which he had been given birth--the spot in which his mother
had died; the spot wherein he had been stolen from that dying mother's side by
his uncle.</p>

<p class="normal">Thinking thus, as they approached the door, he wondered, too,
if by his presence in that room any inspiration would come to him as to how this
other man had been made to supersede him, to appear as himself in the eyes of
the little world in which he moved and lived. A man received as being what he
was not, without question and with his claim undisputed.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Go in,&quot; Paz whispered now, as he turned the handle. &quot;Go in.
From the window you see all that pass--if anything pass. Or you easy get on
balcony. Your room there to right, hers there to left. If she go from one to
other--then--you surely see.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You will not accompany me?&quot; Julian asked, wondering for the
moment if there was treachery lurking in the man's determination to leave him at
so critical a time; wondering, too, if, after all, he was about to warn the
woman whom he, Julian, now sought to entrap in some nefarious midnight
proceeding, of her danger. Yet, he argued with himself, that must be impossible.
If he intended to do that, would he have divulged how Zara had changed one dish
of food for another, so that he who set the trap had himself been caught in it;
would he have given him so real a sign as to what use the phial had been put to
as by placing it, empty, in his hands?</p>

<p class="normal">And, even though now Paz should meditate treachery--as, in
truth, he did not believe he meditated it--still he cared nothing. What he had
resolved to do he would do. What he had begun he would go on with. Now--at
once--this very night!</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No. No,&quot; Paz said, in answer to his question. &quot;No. I come not
with you. I live not here but in plantation mile away. If I found
here--he--he--try kill me. But you he will not kill. You big, strong, brave.
And,&quot; the man continued in a whisper that was in truth a hiss, &quot;it is you who
must kill. Kill! Kill! Remember the snake in bed, the shot in wood, the mountain
mullet, the Amancay. Now, I go. This is the room.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Then almost imperceptibly he was gone, his form disappearing
like a black blur on the still darker, denser blackness of the corridor.</p>

<p class="normal">Without hesitation, Julian softly turned the handle and
entered the room that gave egress to the balcony which he wished to gain. And
although it was as dark as night itself, there was a something, a feeling of
space, quite perceptible to his highly-strung senses, which told him that it was
a vast chamber--a room suitable for the birth of the son and heir of the great
house and its belongings.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Strange,&quot; he thought to himself, &quot;that thus I should revisit
the place in which I first saw the light--that I, who in the darkness was
spirited away, should, in the darkness, return to it.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Yet, black, impenetrable as all around was, there was an
inferior density of darkness at the other end of the great room, away where the
window was; and towards that he directed his footsteps, knowing that there,
between the laths of the persianas which it possessed in common with every other
room in the house, would be his opportunity. There was the coign of vantage
through which he could keep watch and make observations.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;For,&quot; he thought, &quot;if I see her going from her room to mine I
shall know enough, as also I shall do if I see her returning from mine to hers.
While, if she does neither, then it will be easy enough to discover whether she
has been to that room or is in it still.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He was close by the window now, having felt his way carefully
to it; he proceeded slowly so as to stumble against no obstacle nor make any
noise; and then he knew that, should any form, however shrouded, pass before
this window he could not fail to observe it. It was not so dark outside as to
prevent that; also the gleam of the stars was considerable. And as Paz had done
outside on the balcony last night, so he did now inside the room. He lowered
himself noiselessly to the floor, kneeling on the soft carpet which this, the
principal bedchamber possessed, while through a slat a foot from the ground,
which he turned gently with his finger, he gazed out.</p>

<p class="normal">At first nothing occurred. All was as still, as silent as
death; save for sometimes the bark of a distant dog, the chatter of an aroused
bird in the palms near by, and the occasional midnight howl of a baboon farther
away.</p>

<p class="normal">Wonderfully still it was; so undisturbed, indeed, except for
those sounds, that almost a breath of air might have been heard.</p>

<p class="normal">Then, after half an hour, he heard a noise. The noise being a
gentle one, but still perceptible, of the rattle of the persianas belonging to
some window a little distance off. And to the left of him. Surely to the left of
him!</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;She is coming,&quot; he thought, holding his breath. &quot;Coming. On
her way to my room. To do what? What?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">But now the silence was again intense. Upon the boards of the
veranda he could hear no footfall--Nothing. Not even the creak of one of the
planks. Nothing! What had she done? What was she doing? Almost he thought that
he could guess. Could divine how she--this woman of mystery, this midnight
visitor who had crouched near his bed some twenty-four hours ago, who had stolen
forth from his room into the storm as a thwarted murderess might have
stolen--having now reached the veranda, was pausing to make sure that all was
safe; to make sure that there was nothing to thwart her; to disturb her in the
doing of that--whatever it might be--which she meditated.</p>

<p class="normal">Then there did fall a sound upon his ears, yet one which he
only heard because it was close to him; because also all was so still. The sound
of an indrawn breath, gentle as the sigh given in its sleep by a little child,
yet issuing from a breast that had long been a stranger to the innocence of
childhood. An indrawn breath, that was in truth--that must be--the effect of a
supreme nervousness, of fear.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Who is she?&quot; he wondered to himself, while still--his own
breath held--he watched and listened. &quot;What is she to him? She is twice his age.
Surely this is not the love of the hot, passionate Southern woman! What can she
be to him that thus she jeopardizes her life? In my place many men would shoot
her dead who caught her as--as--I--shall catch her--ere long.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">For he knew now (as he could not doubt!) that no step was to
be omitted which should remove him from Desolada, from existence.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Sebastian and she both know that he fills my place.
Well--to-night we come to an understanding. To-night I tell them that I know it
too.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">While he thus meditated, from far down at the front of the
house there once more arose the trolling of a song in Sebastian's deep bass
tones. A noisy song; a drinking, carousing song; one that should have had for
its accompaniment the banging of drums and the braying of trombones.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Bah!&quot; muttered Julian to himself, &quot;you are too late,
vagabond! Shout and bellow as much as you choose--hoping thereby to drown all
other sounds, such as those of stealthy feet and rattling window blinds, or to
throw dust in my eyes. Shout as much as you like. She is here on her evil
errand--a moment later she will be in my hands.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">In truth it seemed to be so. Past where his eyes were, there
went now, as that boisterous song uprose, a black substance which obscured the
great gleaming stars from them--the lower part of a woman's gown. Amid the
turmoil that proceeded from below, she was creeping on towards her goal.</p>

<p class="normal">Julian could scarcely restrain himself now--now that she had
passed onward: almost was he constrained to thrust aside the blinds of this
great window and spring out upon the woman. But he knew it was not yet the time,
though it was at hand. She must be outside the window of his own room by now.
The time was near.</p>

<p class="normal">Therefore, taking care that neither should his knees crack nor
any other sound whatever be made by him, he rose to his feet. Then, he put his
hand to the side of the laths to be ready to thrust them aside and follow her.
But, perhaps, because that hand was not as steady as it should have been, those
laths rattled the slightest. Had she heard? No! He knew that could not be, since
now he heard the rattling of others--of those belonging to his own room. Those
would drown the lesser noise that he had made--those----</p>

<p class="normal">He paused in his reflections, amazed. Down where his room was
to the right he heard a sound greater than any which could be caused by the
gentle pushing aside of a Venetian blind--he heard a smothered cry, and also
something that resembled a person stumbling forward, falling!</p>

<p class="normal">Then in a moment he recollected. He knew what had happened. He
had forgotten to remove the cord he had stretched across the window at midday
ere he slept. He had left it there, and she had fallen forward over it.</p>

<p class="normal">In a moment he was, himself, on the veranda and outside the
window of his own darkened room. In another he was in that room, had struck a
match, and saw her--shrouded, hooded to the eyes--over by the door opening on to
the corridor and endeavouring to unfasten it. He noticed, too, that one arm,
above the wrist, was bandaged. But she was too late. He had caught her now.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;So,&quot; he said, &quot;I know who my visitor is at last, Madame
Carmaux. And I think I know your object here. Have you not dropped another phial
in your fall and broken it? The room is full of the hateful odour of the Amancay
poison.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">She made him no answer, so that he felt sure she was
determined not to let him hear her voice, but he felt that she was trembling all
over, even as she writhed in his grasp, endeavouring to avoid it. Then, knowing
that words were unnecessary, he opened the door into the corridor and bade her
go forth.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You know this house well and can find your way easily in the
dark. Meanwhile, I am now going to descend to have an explanation with the
master of Desolada.&quot;</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="div1_26" href="#div1Ref_26">CHAPTER XXVI.</a></h4>

<h5>&quot;YOU HAVE KILLED HIM!&quot;</h5>
<br>

<p class="normal">Before however, Julian descended to confront
Sebastian he thought it was necessary to do two things; first, to light the lamp
to see how much of that accursed Amancay had been spilt by the broken phial, and
next--which was the more important--to recharge and look to his revolver. For he
thought it very likely that after he had said all he intended to say to
Sebastian, he might find the weapon useful.</p>

<p class="normal">When he had obtained a light by the aid of the matches which
he was never without, he saw that his surmises were fully justified. Upon the
floor there lay, glistening, innumerable pieces of broken glass and the half of
a broken phial, while all around the <i>débris</i> was a small pool of liquid
shining on the polished wooden floor. And from it there arose an odour so
pungent and so f&#339;tid, that he began almost at once to feel coming over him
the hazy, drowsy stupefaction that he had been conscious of last night. So
seizing his water-jug he unceremoniously sluiced the floor with its contents,
washing away and subduing the noisome exhalation; when taking his revolver from
his pocket and seeing carefully to its being charged, he dropped it into his
pocket again. He took with him, too, the remnants of the broken phial.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I shall only return here to pack my few things,&quot; he thought
to himself, &quot;but, all the same it is as well to have destroyed that stuff.
Otherwise the room would have been poisoned with it.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">And now--taking no light with him, for his experience of the
last two hours had taught him, even had he not known it before, the way down to
the garden--he descended, going out by the way that Paz had led him and so
around to the lower veranda. A moment later he reached it, and mounting the
steps, entered the saloon in which he expected to find Sebastian.</p>

<p class="normal">The man was there, he saw at once even before he stood close
by the open window. He was there, sitting at the great table where the meals
were partaken of; but looking dark and brooding now. Upon his face, as Julian
could easily perceive, there was a scowl, and in his eyes an ominous look that
might have warned a less bold man than the young sailor that he was in a
dangerous mood.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Has she been with him already,&quot; Julian wondered, &quot;and
informed him that their precious schemes are at an end, are discovered?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Ha!&quot; exclaimed Sebastian, looking fixedly at him, as now
Julian advanced into the room, &quot;so you are well enough to come downstairs
to-night. Yet--it is a little late. You have scarcely come to sing me those
wardroom songs you spoke of, I suppose!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No,&quot; Julian said, &quot;it is not to sing songs that I am here.
But to talk about serious matters. Sebastian Ritherdon--if you are Sebastian
Ritherdon, which I think doubtful--you have got to give me an explanation
to-night, not only of who you really are, but also of the reason why, during the
time I have been in this locality, you have four times attempted my life, or
caused it to be attempted.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Are you mad?&quot; the other exclaimed, staring at him with still
that ominous look upon his face. &quot;You must be to talk to me like this.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No,&quot; Julian replied. &quot;Instead, perfectly sane. I was,
perhaps, more or less demented last night when under the influence of the fumes
of the Amancay plant which had been sprinkled on my pillow, as well as on my
jacket and waistcoat; and you also were more or less demented to-night when you
had by an accident taken some of the poison into your system, owing to you
making a meal of the doctored mountain mullet you had prepared for me--your
guest. But--now--we are both recovered and--an explanation is needed.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;My God!&quot; exclaimed Sebastian, &quot;you must be mad!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Yet, in his own heart, he knew well enough that never was the
calm, determined-looking man before him--the man who, hitherto, had been so
bright and careless, but who now stood stern as Nemesis at the other end of the
table--further removed from madness than he was this night. He knew and felt
that it was not with a lunatic but an avenger that he had to deal.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I am not mad,&quot; Julian replied calmly. &quot;Meanwhile, take your
right hand out of that drawer by your side, and keep it out. Pistol shots will
disturb the whole house, and, if you do not do as I bid you I shall have to fire
first,&quot; and he tapped his breast significantly as he spoke, so that the other
could be in no doubt of his meaning.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Now,&quot; he continued, when Sebastian had obeyed him, he
laughing with a badly assumed air of contempt as he did so, all the same, laying
his large brown hand upon the table--&quot;now,&quot; said Julian, &quot;I will tell you all
that I believe to be the case in connection with you and with me, all that I
know to have been the case in connection with your various attempts to injure
me, and, also, all that I intend to do, to-morrow, when I reach Belize and have
taken the most eminent lawyer in the place into my confidence.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">As he mentioned the word &quot;lawyer,&quot; Sebastian started visibly;
then, once more, he assumed the contemptuous expression he had previously
endeavoured to exhibit, but beyond saying roughly again that Julian was a
madman, he made no further remark for the moment, and sat staring, or rather
glaring, at the other man before him. Yet, had that other man been able to
thoroughly comprehend, or follow, that glance--which, owing to the lamp being
between them, he was not entirely able to do--he would have seen that, instead
of resting on his face, it was directed to beyond where he stood. That it went
past him to away down to the farther end of the room; to where the open window
was.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Charles Ritherdon,&quot; said Julian now, &quot;had a son born in this
house twenty-six years ago, and that son was stolen within two or three days of
his birth by his uncle, George Ritherdon. You are not that son, and you know it.
Yet you know who is. You know that I am.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You lie,&quot; Sebastian said with an oath; &quot;you are an impostor.
And even if what you say is true--who am I? I,&quot; he said, his voice rising now,
either with anger or excitement, &quot;who have lived here all my life, who have been
known from a child by dozens of people still alive? Who am I, I say?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;That at present I do not know. Perhaps the lawyer to whom I
confide my case will be able to discover.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Lawyer! Bah! A curse for your lawyers. What can you tell him,
what proof produce?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">And still, as he spoke, he kept his eyes fixed, as Julian
thought, upon him, but in absolute fact upon that portion of the room which was
in shadow behind where the latter stood.</p>

<p class="normal">Upon, too--although Julian knew it not, and did not, indeed,
for one moment suspect such to be the case--a white face, that, peeping round
the less white curtains which hung by the window, never moved the dark eyes that
shone out of it from off the back of the man who confronted Sebastian. Fixed
upon, too, the form to which that face belonged, which, even as Sebastian had
raised his voice, had drawn itself a few feet nearer to the other; finding
shelter now behind the curtains of the next or nearest window.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I can at least produce the proofs,&quot; Julian replied, his eyes
still regarding the other, and knowing nothing of that creeping listener behind,
&quot;that my presence in Honduras--at Desolada as your invited guest--caused you so
much consternation, so much dismay, that you hesitated at nothing which might
remove me from your path. What will the law believe, what will these people who
have known you from your infancy--as you say--think, when they learn that three
times at least, if not more, you have attempting my life?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Again I say it is a lie!&quot; Sebastian muttered hoarsely.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And I can prove that it is the truth. I can prove that this
woman, this accomplice of yours--this woman whom my father--not <i>your</i>
father, but <i>my</i> father--jilted, threw away, so that he might marry Isobel
Leigh, my mother--fired at me with a rifle known to be hers and used by her on
small game. I can prove that she poisoned the meal that was to be partaken of by
me; that even so late as to-night she drenched the floor of my room--as she
meant again to drench the pillow on which I slept--with the deadly juice of the
Amancay--with this,&quot; and he held before Sebastian the broken phial he had found
above.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You can prove nothing,&quot; Sebastian muttered hoarsely,
raucously. &quot;Nothing.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Can I not? I have two witnesses.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Two witnesses!&quot; the other whispered, and now indeed he looked
dismayed. &quot;Two witnesses. Yet--what of that, of them! Even though they could
prove this--which they can not--what else can they prove? Even though I am not
Charles Ritherdon's son and you are--even though such were the case--which it is
not--how prove it?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;That remains to be seen. But, though it should never be
proved; even though you and that murderous accomplice of yours, that discarded
sweetheart of my father's, that woman who I believe, as I believe there is a God
in Heaven, was the prime mover in this plot----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Silence!&quot; cried Sebastian, springing to his feet now, yet
still with that look in his eyes which Julian did not follow; that look towards
where the white corpse-faced creature was by this time--namely, five feet nearer
still to Julian--&quot;silence, I say. That woman is not, shall not, be defamed by
you. Neither here or elsewhere. She--she--is--ah! God, she has been my guardian
angel--has repaid evil for good. My father threw her off--discarded her--and she
came here, forgiving him at the last in his great sorrow. She helped to rear
me--his son--to----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Now,&quot; said Julian, still calmly, &quot;it is you who lie, and the
lie is the worse because you know it. Some trick was played on him whom you
still dare to call your father, on him who was mine--never will I believe he was
a party to it!--and before Heaven I do believe that it was she who played it.
She never forgave him for his desertion of her; she, this would be
murderess--this poisoner--and--and--ah!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">What had happened to him? What had occurred? As he uttered the
last words, accusing that woman of being a murderess in intention, if not in
fact--a poisoner--he felt a terrible concussion at the nape of his neck, a blow
that sent him reeling forward towards the other side of that table against which
Sebastian had sat, and at which he now stood confronting him. And, dazed, numbed
as this blow had caused him to become, so that now the features of the man
before him--those features that were so like his own!--were confused and
blurred, though with still a furious, almost demoniacal expression in them, he
scarcely understood as he gave that cry that in his nostrils was once more the
sickening overpowering odour of the Amancay--that it was suffocating, stifling
him.</p>

<p class="normal">Then with another cry, which was not an exclamation this time,
but instead, a moan, he fell forward, clutching with his hands at the
tablecloth, and almost dragging the lamp from off the table. Fell forward thus,
then sank to his knees, and next rolled senseless, oblivious to everything, upon
the floor.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You have killed him!&quot; muttered Sebastian hoarsely, and with
upon his face now a look of terror. &quot;You have killed him! My God! if any others
should be outside, should have seen&quot;--while, forgetting that what he was about
to do would be too late if those others might be outside of whom he had spoken,
he rushed to both the windows and hastily closed the great shutters, which,
except in the most violent tempests that at scarce intervals break over British
Honduras, were rarely used.</p>

<p class="normal">And she, that woman standing there above her victim with her
face still white as is the corpse's in its shroud, her lips flecked with specks
of foam, her hands quivering, muttered in tones as hoarse as Sebastian's:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Killed him. Ay! I hope so. Curse him, there has been enough
of his prying, his seeking to discover the truth of our secret. And--and--if it
were not so--then, still, I would have done it. You heard--you heard--how he
sneered, gloated over my despair, my abandonment by Charles Ritherdon, so that
he might marry that child--that chit--Isobel Leigh. The woman who cursed, who
broke my life. Killed him, Sebastian! Killed him! Yes! That at least is what I
meant to do. Because, Heaven help me! you were not man enough to do it
yourself.&quot;</p>
<br>

<h4><a name="div1_27" href="#div1Ref_27">CHAPTER XXVII.</a></h4>

<h5>&quot;I WILL SAVE YOU.&quot;</h5>
<br>

<p class="normal">Beatrix Spranger sat alone in her garden at
&quot;Floresta,&quot; and was the prey to disquieting, nay, to horrible, emotions and
doubts. For, by this time, not only had forty-eight hours passed since she had
heard from Julian--forty-eight hours, which were to mark the limit of the period
when, as had been arranged, she was to consider that all was still well with the
latter at Desolada! but also another twelve hours had gone by without any letter
coming from him. And then--then--while the girl had become almost maddened,
almost distraught with nervous agitation and forebodings as to some terrible
calamity having occurred to the man she had learned to love--still another
twelve hours had gone by, it being now three days since any news had reached
her.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What shall I do?&quot; she whispered to herself as, beneath the
shade of the great palms, she sat musing; &quot;what! what! Oh! if father would only
counsel me; yet, instead, he reiterates his opinion that nothing can be intended
against him--that he must have gone on some sporting expedition inland, or is on
his way here. If I could only believe that! If I could think so! But I know it
is not the case. It cannot be. He vowed that nothing should prevent him from
writing every other day so long as he was alive or well enough to crawl to the
gate and intercept the mail driver; and he would keep his word. What, what,&quot; she
almost wailed, &quot;can have happened to him? Can they have murdered him?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Even as the horrid word &quot;murder&quot; rose to her thoughts--a word
horrid, horrible, when uttered in the most civilized and well-protected spots on
earth, but one seeming still more terrible and ominous when thought of in
lawless places--there came an interruption to her direful forebodings. The
parrots roosting in the branches during the burning midday heat plumed
themselves, and opened their startled, staring eyes and clucked faintly, while
Beatrix's pet monkey--still, as ever, presenting an appearance of misery and
dark despair and woe--opened its own eyes and gazed mournfully across the
parched lawn.</p>

<p class="normal">For these creatures had seen or heard that which the girl
sitting there had not perceived, and had become aware that the noontide
stillness was being broken by the advent of another person. Yet when Beatrix,
aroused, cast her own eyes across the yellow grass, she observed that the
newcomer was no more important person than a great negro, who carried in one
hand a long whip such as the teamsters of the locality use, and in the other a
letter held between his black finger and thumb.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He has written!&quot; she exclaimed to herself, &quot;and has sent it
by this man. He is safe. Oh! thank God!&quot; while, even as she spoke, she advanced
towards the black with outstretched hand.</p>

<p class="normal">Yet she was doomed to disappointment when, after many bows and
smirks and a removal of his Panama hat, so that he stood bareheaded in the
broiling sun (which is, however, not a condition of things harmful to negroes,
even in such tropical lands), the man had given her the letter, and she saw that
the superscription was not in the handwriting of Julian, but in that of his
supposed cousin, Sebastian.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What does it mean?&quot; she murmured half aloud and half to
herself, while, as she did so, the hand holding the letter fell by her side.
&quot;What does it mean?&quot; Then, speaking more loudly and clearly to the negro, &quot;have
you brought this straight from Desolada?&quot;--the very mention of that place giving
her a weird and creepy sensation.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Bring him with the gentleman's luggage, missy,&quot; the man
replied, with the never-failing grin of his race. &quot;Gentleman finish visit there,
then come on here pay little visit. Steamer go back New Orleans to-morrow,
missy, and gentleman go in it to get to England. Read letter, missy, perhaps
that tell you all.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">The advice was as good as the greatest wiseacre could have
given Beatrix, in spite of its proceeding from no more astute Solomon than this
poor black servant, yet the girl did not at first profit by it. For, indeed, she
was too stunned, almost it might be said, too paralyzed, to do that which,
besides the negro's suggestion, her own common sense would naturally prompt her
to do. Instead, she stood staring at the messenger, her hand still hanging idly
by her side, her face as white as the healthy tan upon it would permit it to
become.</p>

<p class="normal">And though she did not utter her thoughts aloud, inwardly she
repeated again and again to herself, &quot;His luggage! His luggage! And he is going
back to England to-morrow. Without one word to me in all these hours that have
passed, and after--after--oh! Without one word to me! How can he treat me so!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">She had turned her face away from the negro as she thought
thus, not wishing that even this poor creature should be witness of the distress
she knew must be visible upon it, but now she turned towards him, saying:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Go to the house and tell the servants to give you some
refreshment, and wait till I come to you. I shall know what to do when I have
read this letter.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Then she went back to her basket-chair and, sitting in the
shade, tore open Sebastian's note. Yet, even as she did so, she murmured to
herself, &quot;It cannot be. It cannot be. He would not go and leave me like this.
Like this! After that day we spent together.&quot; But resolutely, now, she forced
herself to the perusal of the missive.</p>
<br>

<p class="normal">Dear Miss Spranger (it ran): Doubtless, you have heard from Cousin Julian (who,
I understand, writes frequently to you) that he has been called back suddenly to
England to join his ship, and leaves Belize to-morrow, by the Carib Queen for
New Orleans.</p>

<p class="normal">But, as you also know, he is an ardent sportsman, and said he
must have one or two days' excitement with the jaguars, so he left us yesterday
morning early, in company with a rather villainous servant of mine, named Paz,
and, as I promised him I would do, I now send on his luggage to your father's
house, where doubtless he will make his appearance in the course of the day.</p>

<p class="normal">I wish, however, he could have been induced to stay a little
longer with us, and I also wish he had not taken Paz, who is a bad character,
and, I believe, does not like him. However, Ju is a big, powerful fellow, and
can, of course, take care of himself.</p>

<p class="normal">With kind regards to Mr. Spranger and yourself,</p>

<p style="text-indent:40%">I am, always yours sincerely,</p>

<p style="text-indent:50%"><span class="sc">Sebastian Ritherdon.</span></p>
<br>

<p class="normal">Beatrix let the note fall into her lap and lie there for a moment, while in her
clear eyes there was a look of intense thought as they stared fixedly at the
thirsty, drooping flamboyants and almandas around her: then suddenly she started
to her feet, standing erect and determinate, the letter crushed in her hand.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is a lie,&quot; she said to herself, &quot;a lie from beginning to
end. Written to hoodwink me--to throw dust in my eyes--to--to--keep me quiet.
'Paz does not like him,' she went on, 'Paz does not like him.' No, Sebastian, it
is you whom he does not like, and to use Jul--Mr. Ritherdon's own quaint
expression--you have 'given yourself away.' Well! so be it. Only if you--you
treacherous snake! have not killed him with the help of that other snake, that
woman, your accomplice, we will outwit you yet.&quot; And she went forward swiftly
beneath the shade of the trees to the house.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Where is that man?&quot; she asked of another servant, one of her
own and as ebony as he who had brought the luggage and the letter; &quot;send him to
me at once.&quot; Then, when the messenger from Desolada stood before her, she said:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Tell Mr. Ritherdon you have delivered his letter, and that I
have read and understand it. You remember those words?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">The negro grinned and bowed and, perhaps to show his
marvellous intelligence and memory, repeated the words twice, whereon Beatrix
continued:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;That is well. Be sure not to forget the message. Now, have
you brought in the luggage?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">For answer the other glanced down the long, darkened, and
consequently more or less cool hall, and she, following that glance, saw
standing at the end of it a cabin trunk with, upon it, a Gladstone bag as well
as a rifle. Then, after asking the man if he had been provided with food and
drink, she bade him begone.</p>

<p class="normal">Yet, recognising that if, as she feared, if indeed, as she
felt sure beyond the shadow of a doubt, Julian Ritherdon was in some mortal
peril (that he was dead she did not dare to, would not allow herself to, think
nor believe) no time must be wasted, she gave orders that the buggy should be
got ready at once to take her into the city to her father's offices.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He,&quot; she thought, &quot;is the only person who can counsel me as
to what is best, to do. And surely, surely, he will not attempt to prevent me
from sending, nay, from taking assistance, to Julian. And if he does,
then--then--I must tell him that I love----&quot; But, appalled even at the thought
of having to make use of such a revelation, she would not conclude the sentence,
though there were none to hear it. Instead, she walked back into the garden,
and, seating herself, resolved that she would think of nothing that might
unnerve her or cause her undue agitation before she saw her father; and so sat
waiting calmly until they should come to tell her that the carriage was ready.</p>

<p class="normal">But she did not know, as of course it was impossible that she
should know, that drawing near to her was another woman who would bring her such
information of what had recently taken place at Desolada as would put all
surmises and speculations as to why Sebastian Ritherdon's letter had been
written--the lying letter, as she had accurately described it--into the shade. A
woman who would tell her that if murder had not yet been done in the remote and
melancholy house, it was intended to be done, was brewing; would be done ere
long, if Julian Ritherdon did not succumb to the injuries inflicted on him by
Madame Carmaux. One who would give her such information that she would be
justified in calling upon the authorities of Belize to instantly take steps to
proceed to Desolada, and (then and there) to render Sebastian and his accomplice
incapable of further crimes.</p>

<p class="normal">A woman--Zara--who almost from daybreak had set out from the
lonely hacienda with the determination of reaching Belize somehow and of warning
Beatrix, the Englishman's friend, of the danger that threatened that Englishman;
above all, and this the principal reason, with the determination of saving
Sebastian from the commission of a crime which, once accomplished, could never
be undone. Yet, also, in her scheming, half-Indian brain, there had arisen other
thoughts, other hopes.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;She loves him; this cold, pale-faced English girl loves
Sebastian,&quot; she thought, still cherishing that delusion as she made her way
sometimes along the dusty road, sometimes through copses and groves and
thickets, all the paths of which she knew. &quot;She loves him. But,&quot; and as this
reflection rose in her mind her scarlet lips parted with a bitter smile, and her
little pearl-like teeth glistened, &quot;when she knows, when I show her how cruel,
how wicked he has intended to be to that other man, so like him yet so
different, then--then--ah! then, she will hate him.&quot; And again she smiled, even as she pursued her way.&quot;She will hate him--these English can hate, though they know
not what real love means--and then when he finds he has lost her, he
will--perhaps--love me. Ah!&quot; And at the thought of the love she longed so for,
her eyes gleamed more softly, more starlike, in the dim dawn of the forest
glade.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I shall save him--I shall save him from a
crime--then--he--will--love me.&quot; And still the look upon her face was ecstatic.
&quot;Will marry me. My blood is Indian, not negro--'tis that alone with which these
English will not mix theirs; the negro women alone with whom they will never
wed. Ah! Sebastian,&quot; she murmured, &quot;I must save you from a crime and--from her.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">And so she went on and on, seeing the daffodil light of the
coming day spreading itself all around; feeling the rays of the swift-rising sun
striking through the forests, and parching everything with their fierceness, but
heeding nothing of her surroundings. For she thought only of making the &quot;cold,
pale-faced English girl&quot; despise the man whom she hungered for herself, and of
one other thing--the means whereby to prevent him from doing that which might
deprive him of his liberty--of his life and--also, deprive her of him.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="div1_28" href="#div1Ref_28">CHAPTER XXVIII.</a></h4>

<h5>&quot;I LIVE TO KILL HIM.&quot;</h5>
<br>

<p class="normal">Still she went on, unhalting and resolute,
feeling neither fatigue nor heat, or, if she felt them, ignoring them. She was
resolved to reach Belize, or to fall dead upon the road or in the forests while
attempting to do so.</p>

<p class="normal">And thus she came at last to All Pines, seeing the white inn
gleaming in the first rays of the sun, it being now past six o'clock; while
although her thirst was great, she determined that she would not go near it. She
was known too well there as the girl, Zara, from Desolada, and also as she who
acted as croupier for all the dissipated young planters who assembled at the inn
to gamble, she doing so especially for Sebastian when he held the bank. She
would be recognized at once and her presence commented on.</p>

<p class="normal">Yet she must pass near it, go through the village street to
get forward on her way to Belize; she could only pray in her half-savage way
that there might be none about who would see her, while, even as she did so, she
knew that her chances of escaping observation were of the smallest. In such
broiling lands as those of which Honduras formed one, the earliest and the
latest hours of the day are the hours which are the most utilized because of
their comparative coolness and consequently few are asleep after sunrise.</p>

<p class="normal">Yet, she told herself, perhaps after all it was not of extreme
importance whether she was recognised or not. By to-night, if all went well, and
if the pale-faced English girl and her father had any spirit in them, they would
have taken some steps to prevent that which was meditated at Desolada on this
very night. And, if they had not that spirit, then she herself would utter some
warning, would herself see the &quot;old judge man,&quot; and tell him her story. Perhaps
he would listen to it and believe her even though she was but half-breed trash,
as those of her race were termed contemptuously as often as not.</p>

<p class="normal">But, now, as she drew nearer to the village street, and to
where the inn stood, she started in dismay at what she saw outside the door. An
animal that she recognised distinctly, not only by itself but by the saddle on
its back and the long Mexican stirrups, and also by its colour and flowing mane.</p>

<p class="normal">She recognised the favourite horse of Sebastian, the one he
always rode, standing at the inn door.</p>

<p class="normal">At first a sickening suspicion came to her mind; a fear which
she gave utterance to in the muttered words:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He has followed me. He knows that I have set out for Belize.&quot;
Then she dismissed the suspicion as impossible. For she remembered that
Sebastian had been absent from Desolada all the previous day, and had not
returned by the time when the others had gone to rest; she thought now (and felt
sure that she had guessed aright) that he had slept at the inn all night, and
was about to return to Desolada in the cool of the morning.</p>

<p class="normal">Determined, however, to learn what the master of that
horse--and of her--was about to do, and above all, which direction he went off
in when he came outside, she crept on and on down the street until at last she
was nearly in front of the inn door. Then, lithe and agile as a cat, she stole
behind a great barn which stood facing the <i>plaza</i>, and so was enabled to
watch the opposite house without any possibility of being herself seen from it.</p>

<p class="normal">That something of an exciting nature had been taking place
within the house (even as Zara had sought the shelter behind which she was now
ensconced) she had been made aware by the loud voices and cries she
heard--voices, too, that were familiar to her, as she thought. And about one of
those voices she had no doubt--could have no doubt--since it was that of the man
she loved, Sebastian.</p>

<p class="normal">Then, presently, even as she watched the inn through a crack
in the old and sun-baked barn-door, the turmoil increased; she heard a scuffling
in the passage, more cries and shouts, Sebastian's objurgations rising above
all, and, a moment later, the girl saw the latter dragging Paz out into the open
space in front of the inn. And he was shaking him as a mastiff might shake a rat
that had had the misfortune to find itself in his jaws.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You hound!&quot; he cried, even as he did so; &quot;you will lurk about
Desolada, will you, at light; prying and peering everywhere, as though there
were something to find out. And because you are reproved, you endeavour to run
away to Belize. What for, you treacherous dog? What for? Answer me, I say,&quot; and
again he shook the half-caste with one hand, while with the other he rained down
blows upon his almost grey head.</p>

<p class="normal">But, since the man was extremely lithe, in spite of his age,
many of the blows missed their mark; while taking advantage of the twists and
turns which he, eel-like, was making in his master's hands, he managed during
one of them to wrench himself free from Sebastian. And then, then--Zara had to
force her hands over her mouth to prevent herself from screaming out in terror.
And she had to exercise supreme control over herself also so that she should not
rush forth from her hiding-place and spring at Paz. For, freed from his tyrant's
clutches, he had darted back from him, and a second later, with a swift movement
of his hand to his back, had drawn forth a long knife that glistened in the
morning sun.</p>

<p class="normal">What he said, what his wild words were, cannot be written
down, since most of them were uttered in the Maya dialect; yet amid them were
some that were well understood by Zara and Sebastian; perhaps also by the
landlord of the inn and the two or three half-caste servants huddled near him,
all of them giving signs of the most intense excitement and fear. And Zara,
hearing those words, threw up her hands and covered her face, while Sebastian,
his own face white as that of a corpse's in its shroud, staggered back trembling
and shuddering.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You know,&quot; the latter whispered, &quot;you know that! You know?&quot;
And his hand stole into his open shirt. Yet he drew nothing forth; he did not
produce that which Zara dreaded each instant to see. In truth the man was
paralyzed, partly by Paz's words--yet, doubtless, even more so by the look upon
his face--and by his actions.</p>

<p class="normal">For now Paz was creeping toward the other, even as the panther
creeps through the jungle toward the victim it is about to spring upon; the
knife clutched in his hand, upon his face a gleam of hate so hideous, a look in
his topaz eyes so horrible, that Sebastian stood rooted to the ground. While
from his white and foam-flecked lips, the man hissed:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Shoot. Shoot, curse you! but shoot straight. Into either my
heart or head--for if you miss me!--if you miss me--&quot; and he sprang full on the
other, the knife raised aloft. Sprang at him as the wild cat springs at the
hunter who has tracked it to the tree it has taken refuge in, and when it
recognises that for it there is no further shelter--his face a very hell of
savage rage and spite; his scintillating, sparkling eyes the eyes of an
infuriated devil.</p>

<p class="normal">And Sebastian, cowed--struck dumb with apprehension of such a
foe--a thing half-human and half a savage beast--forgot to draw his revolver
from his breast and seemed mad with dismay and terror. Yet he must do something,
he knew, or that long glittering blade would be through and through him, with
probably his throat cut from ear to ear the moment he was down. He must do
something to defend, to save himself.</p>

<p class="normal">Recognising this even in his mortal terror, he struck out
blindly--whirling, too, his arms around in a manner that would have caused an
English boxer to roar with derision, had he not also been paralyzed with the
horror of Paz's face and actions. He struck out blindly, therefore, not knowing
what he was doing, and dreading every instant that he would feel the hot bite of
the steel in his flesh, and--so--saved himself.</p>

<p class="normal">For in one of those wild, uncalculated blows, his right fist
alighted on Paz's jaw, and, because of his strength, which received accession
from his maddened fury and fear, felled the half-caste to the earth, where he
lay stunned and moaning; the deadly knife beneath him in the dust.</p>

<p class="normal">For an instant Sebastian paused, his trembling and bleeding
hand again seeking his breast, and his fury prompting him to pistol the man as
he lay there before him. But he paused only for a moment, while as he did so, he
reflected that if he slew the man who was at his mercy now it would be
murder--and that murder done before witnesses--then turned away to where his
horse stood, and, flinging himself into the saddle, rode off swiftly to
Desolada.</p>

<p class="normal">As he disappeared, Zara came forth from behind the door where
she had been lurking, an observer of all that had taken place, and forgetting,
or perhaps heedless, of whether she was now seen or not, ran toward Paz and
lifted his head up in her arms.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Paz, Paz,&quot; she whispered in their own jargon. &quot;Paz, has he
killed you? Answer.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">From beneath her the man looked up bewildered still, and
half-stunned by the blow; then, after a moment or so, he muttered, &quot;No, no! I
live--to--to kill him yet.&quot; And Zara hearing those words shuddered, for since
they were both of the same half wild and savage blood, she knew that unless she
could persuade him to forego his revenge, he would do just as he had said, even
though he waited twenty years for its accomplishment.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No,&quot; she said, &quot;no. You must not. Not yet, at least, Paz,
promise me you will not. I--I--you know--I love him. For my sake--mine, Paz,
promise.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I do worse,&quot; said Paz, &quot;I ruin him--drive him away. Zara, I
know his secret--now.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What secret?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Who he is. Ah!--&quot; for Zara had clapped her little brown hand
over his mouth, as though she feared he was going to shout out that secret
before the landlord of the inn and his servants, all of whom were still hovering
near. &quot;Ah, I not tell it now. But to the other--the cousin--I tell it. Because
I--know it, Zara.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;So,&quot; she whispered, &quot;do I. But not now. Do not tell it now.
Paz, I go to Belize to fetch succour. He will kill <i>him</i> if it comes not
soon.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He will kill him to-night, perhaps. I, too, was going to
Belize.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Where is he now?&quot; the girl asked; &quot;where is the handsome
cousin? Where have they put him?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;In the room at end of corridor, with the steps outside to
garden. Easy bring him down them.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Will he die?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Not of wound,&quot; the man said, his eyes sparkling again, but
this time with intelligence, with suggestion. &quot;Not of
wound--but--of--what--they--do--to-night.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I must go,&quot; Zara cried, springing to her feet. &quot;I must go.
Every minute is gold, and--it is many miles.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Take the mule,&quot; Paz said. &quot;It is there. There,&quot; and he
glanced towards the stables. &quot;Take him. He go fast.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I will take him,&quot; she replied, &quot;but--but--promise me, Paz,
that you will do nothing until I return. Nothing--no harm to him. Else I will
not go.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I will promise,&quot; the man said, rising now to his feet, and
staggering a little from his giddiness. &quot;I will promise--you. Yet, I look after
him--I take care he do very little more harm now.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Keep him but from evil till to-night--till to-morrow, let him
not hurt Mr. Ritherdon, then all will be well.&quot; And accompanied by Paz, she went
toward the stable where his mule was.</p>

<p class="normal">It took but little time for the girl to spring to its back, to
ride it out at a sharp trot from the open plaza, and, having again extorted a
promise from Paz, to be once more on her road toward Belize--she not heeding now
the fierceness of the rays of the sun, which was by this time mounting high in
the heavens.</p>

<p class="normal">And so at last she drew near to &quot;Floresta,&quot; which she knew
well enough was Mr. Spranger's abode; near to where the other girl was causing
preparations to be made for reaching her father and telling him what she had
learned through the arrival of the negro--she never dreaming of the further
revelations that were so soon to be made to her. Revelations by the side of
which the lying letter and the lying action of Sebastian in sending forward
Julian's luggage would sink into insignificance.</p>

<p class="normal">She sat on in her garden, waiting now for the groom to come
and tell her that the buggy was ready--sat on amid all the drowsy noontide heat,
and then, when once more the parrots rustled their feathers, and the monkey
opened its mournful eyes, she heard behind her a footstep on the grass; a
footstep coming not from the house but behind her, from an entrance far down at
the end of the tropical garden. And, looking around, she saw close to her the
girl Zara, her face almost white now, and her clothes covered with dust.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What is it?&quot; Beatrix cried, springing to her feet. &quot;What
brings you here? I know you, you are Zara; you come from Desolada.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes,&quot; the other answered, &quot;I come from Desolada. From
Desolada, where to-night murder will be done--if it is not prevented.&quot;</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="div1_29" href="#div1Ref_29">CHAPTER XXIX.</a></h4>

<h5>THE WATCHING FIGURE</h5>
<br>

<p class="normal">With a gasp, Beatrix took a step toward the
other, while as she did so the latter almost uttered a moan herself; though her
agitation proceeded from a different cause--from, in truth, her appreciation of
how wide a gulf there was between them. Between them who both loved the same
man! Between this dainty English girl, who looked so fresh and fair, and was
dressed in so spotless and cool a garb, and her who was black and swarthy, her
who was clad almost in rags, and covered with the dust and grime of a long
journey made partly on foot and partly on the mule's back. What chance was there
for her, what hope, she asked herself, that Sebastian should ever love her
instead of this other?</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Murder will be done!&quot; Beatrix exclaimed, repeating Zara's
words, even while a faintness stole over her that she thought must be like the
faintness of coming death. &quot;Murder will be done. To whom? To Mr.--to Lieutenant
Ritherdon?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes,&quot; Zara answered, standing there before the other, and
feeling ashamed as she did so of the appearance she must present to her rival,
as she deemed her. &quot;Yes, murder. The murder of Lieutenant Ritherdon. But, if you
have courage, if you have any power, it may be prevented. And--and--you love
him! I know it. There must be no crime. You love him!&quot; she repeated fiercely.</p>

<p class="normal">Astonished that the girl should know her secret, unable to
understand how she could have learned it, unless for some reason, Lieutenant
Ritherdon might have hinted that he hoped such was the case; abashed at the
secret being known, Beatrix could but stammer: &quot;Yes--yes--I love him.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I love him, too!&quot; Zara exclaimed fiercely, hotly; she neither
stammering, nor appearing to be put to shame. &quot;I love him too. There must be no
crime----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You love him!&quot; Beatrix repeated, startled.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;With my whole heart and soul. Do you think our hot blood is
not as capable of love as the cold blood that runs in your veins?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">But Beatrix could only whisper again, amazed, &quot;You love him
too!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I have loved him all my life,&quot; Zara said. &quot;I have always
loved him. And I will save him.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Then Beatrix understood how they were at cross-purposes, and
that this half-savage girl was here, not to save Julian from being murdered so
much as to save Sebastian from becoming a murderer.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Tell me all,&quot; she said faintly, sinking into her chair, while
she motioned to Zara to seat herself in one of the others that stood close by.
&quot;Tell me all that has happened. Then I shall know perhaps what I am to do.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">And Zara, smothering in her heart the hatred that she felt
against this other girl so much more fair and attractive than she, she who was
but a peasant, almost a slave, while her rival had wealth and bright
surroundings--told her all she knew.</p>

<p class="normal">She narrated how she had watched by day and night to see that
no harm was done to the stranger staying at Desolada: how, sometimes, she had
slept on the upper veranda and sometimes in the grounds and gardens, being ever
on the watch. And then she told the story of all that had happened, of how
Madame Carmaux had tried to shoot Julian in the copse and had herself been
struck in the arm by a bullet from Paz's rifle, but to avoid suspicion had, on
her return to the house, commenced arranging flowers in a bowl with one hand,
she keeping the other, which Zara knew she had hastily bandaged up, out of
sight. She told, too, the whole story of the Amancay poison, and described the
final scene in the lower room which she had witnessed from the garden where she
stood hidden.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And now,&quot; she cried, &quot;now they will kill him to-night, get
rid of him forever, if, before night comes, help does not reach him.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What will they do?&quot; asked Beatrix, white to the lips, and
trembling all over as she had trembled from the first. &quot;Poison him with that
hateful Amancay--or--or----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I know not, but they will kill him. They will not keep him
there. Instead, perhaps, carry him to one of the lagoons where the alligators
are, or to the sea where the white sharks are, or----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Come, come!&quot; cried Beatrix, with a shriek of horror. &quot;Come at
once to my father in the city. Oh! in mercy, come--there is not an hour, not a
moment, to be lost!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">She had seen, almost directly after Zara had made her
appearance, the groom come out from the house, and understood that he was
approaching to tell her that the buggy was prepared, but by a motion of her hand
she had made the man understand that she was not ready. But, now, she must go at
once, and she must take this girl with her--that was all important. For surely,
when some of the legal authorities in Belize had heard the tale which Zara could
tell, they would instantly send assistance to Julian.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Come!&quot; she cried again. &quot;Come! we must go to the city at
once.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It will save--him?&quot; Zara asked, her thoughts still upon the
man who must be prevented at all hazards from committing a horrible crime, and
supposing in her ignorance that it was also the desire to prevent that man from
committing this crime which made Beatrix so anxious. &quot;It will save--him?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes,&quot; Beatrix answered. &quot;Yes. It will save him.&quot;</p>
<br>

<p class="normal">The night had come, suddenly, swiftly, as it always does in Southern lands. Half
an hour earlier a band of twenty people had been riding as swiftly as the heat
would permit along the dusty white thread, which was the road that led past All
Pines on toward Desolada--now the same band was progressing beneath the
swift-appearing stars overhead. The breeze, too, which, not long before, had
burnt them with its fiery sun-struck breath, came cool and fresh and grateful at
this time, since it was no longer laden with heat; while from all the wealth of
vegetation around, there were, distilled by the night dews, the luscious scents
and odours that the flowers of the region possess.</p>

<p class="normal">A band of twenty people--of eighteen men and two women--who,
now that night had fallen, rode more swiftly than they had done before, the trot
of the horses being accompanied by the clang of scabbard against boot and spur,
of jangling bridle and bridle-chain. For among them was a small troop of
constabulary headed by an officer, as well as a handful of the police. Also, Mr.
Spranger formed one of the number. The two women were Beatrix and Zara, the
former having insisted on her father allowing her to accompany the force.</p>

<p class="normal">When Beatrix had caused Zara to go with her to Mr. Spranger's
offices, and then to tell him her tale--a tale supplemented by the former's own
account of the letter from Sebastian accompanied by Julian's luggage--that
gentleman had at once agreed that there was no time to be lost if Julian was to
be saved from any further designs against him. Of course, he and all the
Government officials were well acquainted with each other, the Governor
included, but it was to the Chief Justice that he at once made his way,
accompanied by Zara, who had to tell her tale for a second time to that
representative of authority and law.</p>

<p class="normal">Then the rest was easy--instructions were given to the
Commandant of Constabulary and the Superintendent of Police, and the force set
out. Meanwhile, the latter was provided with a warrant (although neither Beatrix
nor Zara was aware that such was the case) for the arrest of both Sebastian
Ritherdon and Madame Carmaux on a charge of attempted murder.</p>

<p class="normal">And now as the little band passed All Pines, Zara, who rode
close by Beatrix's side, whispered in the latter's ear that she was about to
quit them; she knew, she said, bypaths that she could thread which the others
could not do, or in doing, would only make very slow progress.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;But,&quot; she concluded, still in a whisper, and with her dark
face as close to the fair one of the English girl as she could place it--&quot;I
shall be there when you all arrive. And by then I shall know what has been done,
or what is to be done. He must not kill him; we must stop that. We love him too
well for that.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">And, ere Beatrix could answer, the other had disappeared into
the denseness of the forest, it seeming as though she had power to impart to the
beast which she bestrode her own mysterious and subtle methods of movement.</p>

<p class="normal">At first, she was not missed by any of the others, Mr.
Spranger being the earliest to do so; but by the time he had observed that she
was gone, they had drawn so near to the object of their visit that, even if her
absence was noticed, very little remark was made. For now they were, as most in
the band knew, on the outskirts of the plantations around Desolada; soon they
would be within those plantations and threading their way toward the house
itself. What was noticed, however, as now their horses trod on the soft
luxurious grass beneath their feet--so gently that the thud of their hoofs
became entirely deadened--was that a man, who had certainly not accompanied them
from Belize, was doing so at this moment, and that, as they wended their way
slowly, this man, who was on foot, walked side by side with them.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Who are you?&quot; asked the officer in command of the
constabulary, bending down from his horse to look at the newcomer, and observing
that he was a half-caste. &quot;Do you belong to this property?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I did,&quot; that newcomer said, looking up at the other. &quot;I
did--but not now. Now I belong to you. To the Government, the police.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;So! You desire to give information. Is that it?</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes. That is it.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What can you tell?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;That the Englishman not there--that he taken away already, I
think----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is not so,&quot; a voice whispered close to his ear, yet one
sufficiently loud to be heard by all. &quot;It is not so.&quot; And, looking round, every
one saw the dark, starlike eyes of Zara gleaming through the darkness at them.
&quot;He is there--but he will not be for long if you do not make haste.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">From one of her hearers--from Beatrix--there came a gasp; from
the rest only a few muttered sentences that there was no time to be lost; that
they must attack the house at once, and call on the inhabitants to come forth
and give an account of themselves. Then, once more, the order was issued for the
cavalcade to advance. And silently they did so, Beatrix being placed in the
rear, so that if any violence should be offered, or any resistance, she should
not be exposed to it more than was necessary.</p>

<p class="normal">But there was little or no sign at present of the likelihood
of such resistance being made. Instead, Desolada presented now an appearance
worthy of its mournful name. For all was darkened in and around it; the windows
of the lower floor, especially the windows of the great saloon, from which, or
from its veranda, the light of the lamp had streamed forth nightly, were all
closed and shuttered; nowhere was a glimmer to be seen. And also the door in the
middle of the veranda was closed--a circumstance that certainly during the
summer, would have been unusual in any abode in British Honduras.</p>

<p class="normal">All were close to the steps of the veranda now, and the
officer in command of the constabulary, dismounting from his horse, strode up on
to the latter, while beating upon the door with his clenched fist, he called out
that he required to see Mr. Ritherdon at once. A summons to which no answer was
returned.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;If,&quot; this person said, looking around on those behind him,
and whose forms he could but dimly see--&quot;if no answer is returned, we shall be
forced to break the door down or blow the lock off. Into the house we must get.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;There is now,&quot; said Mr. Spranger, who had also dismounted and
joined him, &quot;a figure on the balcony of the floor above. It has come out from
one of the windows. But I cannot see whether it is man or woman.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;A figure!&quot; cried the other, darting out at once on to the
path beneath, so that thus he could gaze up to the higher balcony. &quot;A figure!&quot;
and then, raising his eyes, he saw that Mr. Spranger had spoken accurately. For,
against the darkness of the night, and the darkness of the house too, there was
perceptible some other darker, deeper blur which was undoubtedly the form of a
person gazing down at them. A form surmounted by something that was a little,
though not much, whiter than its surroundings; something that all who gazed upon
it knew to be a human face.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="div1_30" href="#div1Ref_30">CHAPTER XXX.</a></h4>

<h5>BEYOND PASSION'S BOUND.</h5>

<p class="normal">A human face was gazing down on them from where the body
beneath crouched, as though kneeling against the rails of the veranda--a face
from which more than one in that band thought they could see the eyes
glistening. Yet, from it no sound issued, only--only--still the white face grew
more perceptible and stood out more clearly in the blackness, as the others
continued to stare at it, and the eyes seemed to glitter with a greater
intensity.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Come down,&quot; cried up the officer now, directing his voice
toward where it lurked, &quot;come down and let us in. We have important business
with Mr. Ritherdon.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">But still no reply nor sound was heard.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Come down,&quot; the other said again, &quot;and at once, or we shall
force an entrance; we shall lose no time.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Then from that dark, indistinct mass there did come some
whispered words; words clear enough, however, to be heard by those below.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Who are you?&quot; that voice demanded, &quot;and what do you want?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;We want,&quot; the officer replied, &quot;Mr. Ritherdon. And also,
Madame Carmaux, his housekeeper, and the Englishman who has been staying here.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;The Englishman has gone away, back to England, and Mr.
Ritherdon is at Belize----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Liar!&quot; all heard another voice murmur in their midst, while
looking around, they saw that Zara was still there, standing beside the horses
and gazing up toward the balcony. &quot;Liar! Both are in the house.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Then in a moment she had crept away, and stolen toward where
Beatrix, who had also left the saddle, stood, while, seizing her arm she
whispered, &quot;Follow me. Now is the time.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;To him?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes,&quot; Zara said--&quot;yes, to him. To him you love. You do love
him, do you not?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Ah, yes! Ah, yes! Oh, save him! Save him!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Come,&quot; said Zara--and Beatrix thought that as the other spoke
now, her voice had changed. As, indeed it had. For (still thinking that the
English girl could have but one man in her thoughts, and he the one whom she
herself loved and hated alternately--the latter passion being testified by the
manner in which she had, in a moment of impulse, given him the physic-nut oil
and the poisoned mullet) her blood had coursed like wildfire through her veins
at hearing Beatrix's avowal, and her voice had become choked. For Beatrix had
forgotten in the excitement of the last few hours to undeceive the girl; had
forgotten, indeed, the cross-purposes at which they had been that morning in the
garden at &quot;Floresta;&quot; and thus Zara still deemed that they were rivals--deemed,
too, that this white-faced rival was the favoured one.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;She loves him,&quot; she muttered to herself, her heart and brain
racked with torture and with passion; &quot;she loves him. She loves him. And he
loves her! But--she shall never have him, nor he her. Come,&quot; she cried again,
savagely this time. &quot;Come, then, and see him. And--love him. It will not be for
long,&quot; she added to herself.</p>

<p class="normal">Whereupon she drew Beatrix away toward the back of the house,
going around by the farthest side of it, and on, until, at last, they stood at
the foot of the stairs outside that gave access to the floor above, on that
farthest side. Here, they were quite remote from the parley that was going on
between those who were in the front and the dark shrouded figure on the veranda
above; yet Beatrix noticed that, still, they were not alone. For, as they
approached those outside stairs she saw three or four dark forms vanish away
from them, and steal farther into the obscurity of the night.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Who are those?&quot; she asked timorously, nervously, as she
watched their retreating figures.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Men,&quot; said Zara, &quot;who to-night will take the Englishman, tied
and bound, out to the sea in Sebastian's boat, and sink him.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Oh, my God!&quot; wailed Beatrix, nearly fainting. &quot;Oh! Oh!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;If we do not prevent it. If <i>I</i> do not prevent it.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Then, suddenly, before Beatrix could put her foot on the steps
as Zara had directed her to do, as well as ascend them, she felt her arm grasped
by the latter, and heard her whisper:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Stop! Before we mount to where he is--tell me--tell me
truthfully, has--has he told you he loves you?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You lie!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I do not lie,&quot; Beatrix replied, hotly, scornfully; &quot;I never
lie. But, since you will have the truth--I cannot understand why, what affair it
is of yours--although he has not told me, I know it. Love can be made known
without words.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Her own words struck like a dagger to the other's heart--nay,
they did worse than that. They communicated a spark to the heated, maddening
passions which until now, or almost until now, had lain half-slumbering and
dormant in that heart; they roused the bitterest, most savage feelings that
Zara's half-savage heart had nurtured.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;She scorns me,&quot; she said to herself, &quot;she despises me because
she knows she possesses his love, the love made known without words. Because she
is sure of him. Ay, and so she shall be--but not in life. 'What affair is it of
mine?'&quot; she brooded. &quot;She shall see. She shall see.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Then, as once more she motioned Beatrix to follow her up those
stairs, she, unseen by the latter, dropped her right hand into the bosom of her
dress, and touched something that lay within it.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;She shall see,&quot; she said again. &quot;She shall see.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Above, in that obscure, gloomy corridor to which they now
entered--the corridor which more than once had struck a chill even to the bold
heart of Julian Ritherdon, when he sojourned in the house--all was silent and
sombre, so that one might have thought that they stood upon the first floor of
some long-neglected mansion from which the inhabitants had departed years
before; while the darkness was intense. And, whatever might have been the effect
of the weirdness of the place upon the nerves of Zara, strung up as those nerves
now were to tragic pitch, upon Beatrix, at least, it was intense. A great black
bat, the wind from whose passing wing fanned her cheek and caused her to utter a
startled exclamation, added some feeling of ghastly terror to the surroundings,
while, also, the company in which she was, the company of a half-Indian savage
girl charged with tempestuous passions, contributed to her alarm.</p>

<p class="normal">Yet, on the silence there broke now some sounds, they coming
from the front part of the house; the sound of voices, of a hurried
conversation, of sentences rapidly exchanged.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You hear,&quot; hissed Zara in the other's ear--&quot;you hear--and
understand? 'Tis she--Carmaux. And, as ever, she lies. As her life has always
been, so is her tongue now.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Then Beatrix heard Madame Carmaux saying from the balcony:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He has returned. He is coming, I tell you. But just now he
has ridden to the stables behind. He will be with you at once. He will explain
all. Wait but a few moments more.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It must be but a very few then,&quot; the girl heard in reply, she
recognising the voice of the Commandant of the Constabulary. &quot;Very few. He must
indeed explain all. Otherwise we force our entrance. Not more than five minutes
will be granted.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You understand?&quot; whispered Zara, &quot;you understand? She begs
time so that--so that--the Englishman shall be taken to his death. When he is
gone, Sebastian will show himself.&quot; Though, to her own heart she added, &quot;Never.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I can bear no more,&quot; gasped Beatrix; &quot;I must see him. Go to
him.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Nay,&quot; replied Zara, &quot;he comes to you. Observe. Look behind
you--the way we came.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">And, looking behind her as the other bade, even while she
trembled all over in her fear and excitement, she saw that Sebastian had himself
mounted the stairs outside the house, and was preparing to pass along the
passage; to pass by them.</p>

<p class="normal">Yet, ere he did so, she saw, too, that behind him were those
misty forms of the natives which she had observed to vanish at their approach
below; she heard him speak to them; heard, too, the words he said.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;When I whistle, come up and bear him away. You know the rest.
To my yawl, then a mile out to sea and--then--sink him. Now go, but be ready.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Whereon he turned to proceed along the passage, and, even in
her terror, Beatrix could see that he bore in his hand a little lantern from
which the smallest of rays was emitted. A lantern with which, perhaps, he wished
to observe if his victim still lived, since surely he, who had dwelt in this
house all his life, needed no light to assist him in finding his way about it.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He will see us. He will see us,&quot; murmured Beatrix.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He will never see us again,&quot; answered Zara, and as she spoke,
she drew the other into the deep doorway of one of the bedrooms. &quot;Never again,&quot;
while looking down at her from her greater height, Beatrix saw that her right
hand was at her breast, and that in it something glistened.</p>

<p class="normal">And, now, Sebastian was close to them, going on to the room at
the end of the passage. He was in front of them. He was passing them.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is your last farewell,&quot; said Zara. And ere. Beatrix could
shriek, &quot;No. No!&quot; divining the girl's mistake; ere, too, she could make any
attempt to restrain her, Zara had sprung forth from the embrasure of the
doorway, the long dagger gleaming in her hand, as the sickly rays of Sebastian's
lamp shone on it, and had buried it in his back, he springing around suddenly
with a hoarse cry as she did so--his hands clenched and thrust out before
him--in his eyes an awful glare. Then with a gasp he sank to the floor, the lamp
becoming extinguished as he did so. Whereby, Zara did not understand that, lying
close by the man whom she had slain, or attempted to slay, was Beatrix, who had
swooned from horror, and then fallen prostrate.</p>

<p class="normal">Sebastian had carried his white drill jacket over his arm as
he advanced along the passage, he having taken it off as he mounted the steps,
perhaps with the view of being better able to assist the Indians in the task of
removing Julian when he should summon them. And Zara, full of hate as she was;
full, too, of rage and jealousy as she had been at the moment before she stabbed
him, as well as at the moment when she did so, had observed such to be the case,
when, instantly, there came into her astute brain an idea that, through this
circumstance, might be wreaked a still more deadly vengeance on Sebastian for
his infidelity to her.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He would have sent that other to his death in the sea,&quot; she
thought; &quot;now--false-hearted jaguar--that death shall be yours. If the knife has
not slain you, the water shall.&quot; Whereupon, quick as lightning, she seized the
jacket and disappeared with it down the corridor, entering at the end of the
latter a room in which Julian lay wounded and bound upon a bed. A room in which
there burnt a candle, by the light of which she saw that he who was a prisoner
there was asleep.</p>

<p class="normal">Without pausing to awaken him, she took from off a nail in the
room the navy white jacket that Julian had worn--which like Sebastian's own was
stained somewhat with blood--and, seizing it in one hand and the candle in the
other, went back to where Sebastian lay.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I cannot put it on him,&quot; she muttered, &quot;as he lies thus;
still, it will suffice. The Indians will think it is the other in this light,
since both are so alike.&quot; After which she crept down the passage to the stairs,
and, whistling softly, called up the men outside to her, there being five of
them.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He is here,&quot; she whispered as they approached Sebastian.
&quot;Here. Waste no time; away with him,&quot; while they, with one glance at the
prostrate body, prepared to obey her, knowing how Sebastian confided many things
to her.</p>

<p class="normal">But one of that five never took his eyes off the girl, and
seeing that from beneath the jacket there protruded a hand on which was a
ring--a ring well known by all around Desolada--he drew the jacket over that
hand, covering it up. Yet, as he did so, he contrived also to disarrange the
portion that lay over Sebastian's face--and--to see that face. Whereupon, upon
his own there came an awful look of gloating, even as the Indians bent down and,
lifting their burden, departed with it.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;At last,&quot; he whispered to Zara, &quot;at last. You not endure
longer?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No,&quot; the girl replied. &quot;No longer. He loved
that--that--other--and--and--I slew him. Now, Paz, go--and--sink him beneath the
sea forever.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes. Yes. I sink him. He knew not Paz was near, but Paz never
forget. I sink him deep. But, outside--I take ring away so that Indians not
know. Oh, yes, he sink very deep. Paz never forget.&quot;</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="div1_31" href="#div1Ref_31">CHAPTER XXXI.</a></h4>

<h5>&quot;THE MAN I LOVE.&quot;</h5>
<br>

<p class="normal">Recovering her consciousness, Beatrix
perceived that she was alone. Yet, dimmed though her senses were by the swoon in
which she had lain, she was able to observe that some change had taken place in
the corridor since she fell prostrate. Sebastian Ritherdon's body was gone now,
but the little lamp which he had carried lay close to the spot where she had
seen him fall, while near to it, and standing on the floor, was a candlestick.
Within it was a candle, which showed to her startled eyes something which almost
caused her to faint again; something that formed a small pool upon the shiny,
polished floor. And then as she saw the hateful thing, the recollection of all
that had happened returned to her, as well as the recollection of other things.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He was going to the end of the passage,&quot; she said to herself
as, rising, she drew her skirts closely about her so that they should not come
into contact with that shining, hideous pool at her feet; &quot;therefore, Julian
must be there. Oh, to reach him, to help him to escape from this horrid, awful
house!&quot; Whereon, snatching up the candlestick from the floor, she proceeded
swiftly to the end of the corridor; while, seeing that, far down it, there was
one door open, she naturally directed her footsteps to that.</p>

<p class="normal">Then, as she held the light above her head, she saw that on a
bed there lay a man asleep, or in a swoon--or dead! A man whose eyes were closed
and whose face was deadly white, yet who was beyond doubt Julian Ritherdon.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Oh, Julian!&quot; she gasped, yet with sufficient restraint upon
herself to prevent her voice from awaking him. &quot;Oh, Julian! To find you at last,
but to find you thus,&quot; and she took a step forward toward where the bed was,
meaning to gaze down upon him and to discover if he was in truth alive or not.</p>

<p class="normal">Yet she was constrained to stop and was stayed in her first
attempt to cross the room, by the noise of swift footsteps behind her and by the
entrance of Zara, whose wild beauty appeared now to have assumed an almost
demoniacal expression.</p>

<p class="normal">For the girl's eyes gleamed as the eyes of those in a raging
fever gleam; her features were working terribly, and her whole frame seemed
shaken with emotion.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is done!&quot; she cried exultingly--there being a tone of
almost maniacal derision in her voice. &quot;It is done. In two hours he will be
dead. And I have kept my word to you. You loved him, and you desired to see him.
Well, you have seen him! Did you take,&quot; she almost screamed in her frenzy, &quot;a
long, last farewell? I hope so, since you will never take another,&quot; and in her
fury of despair she thrust her face forward and almost into the other's.</p>

<p class="normal">But, now, hers was not the only wild excitement in the room.
For Beatrix, recognising to what an extreme the girl's jealousy had wrought her,
and what terrible deed she had been guilty of, herself gave a slight scream as
she heard the other's words, and then cried:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Madwoman! Fool! You are deceived. You have deceived yourself.
I never loved him. Nor thought of him. This man lying here, this man whom he
would have murdered, is the one I love with all my heart; this is the man I came
to save.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Then as she spoke, Julian--who was now either awake or had
emerged from the torpor in which he had been lying--cried from out of the
darkness: &quot;Beatrix, Beatrix, oh, my darling!&quot; Whereon she, forgetting that in
her excitement she had proclaimed her love, forgetting all else but that her
lover was safe, rushed toward where he lay, uttering words of thankfulness and
delight at his safety. Yet, when a moment later they looked toward the place
where Zara had been, they saw that she was gone. For, slight as was the glimmer
from the candle, it served to show that she was no longer there; that in none of
the deep shadows of the room was she lurking anywhere.</p>

<p class="normal">She had, indeed, rushed from the room on hearing Beatrix's
avowal, a prey to fresh excitement now, and to fresh horrors.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I have slain him in my folly,&quot; she muttered wildly to
herself. &quot;I have slain him. And--and, at last, I might have won him. God help
me!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Then she directed her footsteps toward where she knew Madame
Carmaux was, toward where her ears told her that, below the balcony on which the
woman stood, they were making preparations to break into the house. Already, she
could hear the hammering and beating on the great door from without; and, so
hearing, thought they must be using some tree or sapling wherewith to break it
in. She recognised, too, the Commandant's voice, as he gave orders to one of his
men to blow the lock off with his carbine.</p>

<p class="normal">But without pause, without stopping for one instant, she
rushed into the room and out upon the balcony where, seizing Madame Carmaux by
the arm, she cried:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Let them come in. It matters not. Sebastian is dead, or will
be dead ere long. I deemed him false to me, as in truth he was. I have sent him
to his doom. The Indians have taken him away to drown him, thinking he is that
other.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Then from a second woman in that house there arose that night
a piercing heartbroken cry, the cry of a woman who has heard the most awful news
that could come to her, a cry followed by the words--as, throwing her hands up
above her head, she sank slowly down on to the floor of the veranda--</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You have slain him--you have sent him to his doom? Oh,
Sebastian! Oh, my son!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, your son,&quot; said Zara. &quot;Your son.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is impossible,&quot; they both heard a voice say behind them,
the voice of Julian, as now he entered the room with Beatrix. &quot;You are mistaken.
Madame Carmaux never had a son, but instead a daughter.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No,&quot; said still another voice, and now it was Mr. Spranger
who spoke, all the party from outside having entered the house at last. &quot;No. She
never had a daughter, though it suited her purpose well enough to pretend that
such was the case, and that that daughter was dead; the birth of her son being
thus disguised.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You hear this,&quot; the man in command of the police said,
addressing the crouching woman. &quot;Is it true?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">But Madame Carmaux, giving him but one glance from her
upturned eyes, uttered no word.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I have a warrant for your arrest and for this man called
Sebastian Ritherdon,&quot; the sergeant said. &quot;If he is not dead we shall have him.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Then I pray God he is dead,&quot; Madame Carmaux cried, &quot;for if
you arrest him you will arrest an innocent man.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">In answer to which the sergeant merely shrugged his shoulders,
while addressing one of his force he bade him keep close to her.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Was he in truth her son?&quot; Julian asked, turning to where a
moment before Zara had been standing. But once more, as so often she had done in
the course of this narrative, the girl had vanished. Vanished, that is, so far
as Julian and one or two others observed now, yet being seen by some of those
who were standing near the door to creep out hurriedly and then to rush madly
down the corridor.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No,&quot; said Madame Carmaux, glaring at him with a glance which,
had she had the power, would have slain him where he stood. &quot;Though I often
called him so. It is a lie.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Is it?&quot; said Julian quietly. &quot;It would hardly seem so. Here
is a paper which was written in England ere I set out for Honduras by the man
whom I thought to be my father, and in which he tells in writing the whole story
he told me by word of mouth. I looked for that paper after his death--and--I
have found it here--in the pocket of Sebastian's jacket.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Such was indeed the case. When Zara had run into the room
where Julian was, and had possessed herself of his jacket with the naval buttons
on it--she meaning by its use to more thoroughly deceive the Indians who were to
take Sebastian away in his stead--she had left behind her the other jacket which
the latter had carried over his arm. And that, in the obscurity of a room lit
only by the one candle, Julian should have hastily donned another jacket so like
his own, and which he found in the place where he had lain for three nights, was
not a surprising thing. But he recognised the exchange directly when, happening
to put his hand into the pocket, he discovered the very missing papers which Mr.
Ritherdon said he was going to leave behind for Julian's guidance, but which he
must undoubtedly have forwarded to his brother, as an explanation--an
account--of his sin against him in years gone by.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Whoever's son he was,&quot; said Mr. Spranger, &quot;he was undoubtedly
not the son of Charles Ritherdon and his wife, Isobel Leigh. There can be no
possibility of that. Who, therefore, can he have been--he who was so like you?&quot;
while, even as he gazed into Julian's eyes, there was still upon his face the
look of incredulity which had always appeared there whenever he discussed the
latter's claim to be the heir of Desolada.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;If she,&quot; said Beatrix now, with a glance toward where Madame
Carmaux sat, rigid as a statue and almost as lifeless, except for her sparkling,
glaring eyes--&quot;if she never had a daughter, but did have a son, why may he not
be that son? Some imposture may have been practised upon Mr. Ritherdon.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is impossible,&quot; her father said. &quot;He knew his own child
was lost--his brother's narrative tells that; she could not have palmed off on
him another child--her own child--in the place of his.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;There is the likeness between us,&quot; whispered Julian in Mr.
Spranger's ear. &quot;How can that be accounted for? Can it be--is it possible--that
in truth two children were born to him at the same time?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No,&quot; said Mr. Spranger. &quot;No. If such had been the case, your
uncle, the man you were brought up to believe in for years as your father, must
have known of it.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Then,&quot; said Julian, &quot;the mystery is as much unsolved as ever,
and is likely to remain so. She,&quot; directing his own glance to Madame Carmaux,
&quot;will never tell--and--well. Heaven help him! Sebastian is probably dead by
now.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;In which case,&quot; said the other, always eminently practical,
&quot;you are the owner of Desolada all the same. If Sebastian was the rightful heir,
and he is dead, you, as Mr. Ritherdon's nephew, come next.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Nevertheless,&quot; replied Julian, &quot;I am not his nephew. I am his
son. I feel it; am sure of it.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">But, even as he spoke, he noticed--had noticed indeed,
already--that there was some stir in the direction where Madame Carmaux was. He
had seen that, as he uttered the words &quot;Heaven help him! Sebastian is probably
dead by now,&quot; she had sprung to her feet, while uttering a piteous cry as she
did so, and had stood scowling at Julian as though it was he who had sent the
other to his doom. Then, too, he had seen that, in spite of the sergeant of
police and one or two of his men having endeavoured to prevent her, she had
brushed them on one side and was crossing the room to where he, with Mr.
Spranger and Beatrix, stood. A moment later, she was before them; facing them.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You have said,&quot; she exclaimed, &quot;that he is probably dead by
now,&quot; and they saw that her face was white and drawn; that it was, indeed,
ghastly. &quot;But,&quot; she continued, &quot;if he is not dead--if yet he should be saved, if
the scheme of that devil incarnate, Zara, should have failed--will you--will you
hold him harmless--if--if--I tell all? Will you hold <i>him</i> harmless! For
myself I care not, you may do with me what you will.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes,&quot; said Julian. &quot;Yes--if you will----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No,&quot; said the sergeant of police. &quot;That is impossible. You
cannot give such a promise. He has to answer to the law.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What!&quot; cried Madame Carmaux, turning on the man, her eyes
flashing--&quot;what if I prove him innocent of everything--of everything attempted
against this one here,&quot; and she indicated Julian.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Do that,&quot; said the sergeant, &quot;and he may escape.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Come, then,&quot; she said, addressing Mr. Spranger and Julian;
&quot;but not you, you bloodhound,&quot; turning on the man. &quot;Not you! Come, I will tell
you everything. I will save him.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">While, making her way through the others as though she still
ruled supreme in the house, and followed by the two men, she led the way to a
small parlour situated upon the same floor they were on.</p>

<h5>THE SHARK'S TOOTH REEF</h5>
<br>

<p class="normal">Meanwhile the night grew on, and with it
there was that accompaniment which is so common in the tropics: the wind rising,
and from blowing lightly soon sprang up into what the sailors call half a gale.</p>

<p class="normal">Now and again, far away to the east, flashes of rusty red
lightning might be seen also, the almost sure heralds of a storm later.</p>

<p class="normal">The wind blew, too, over the dense masses of orange groves and
other vegetation which go to form the tropical jungle that hereabout fringes the
seashore; compact masses that, to many endeavouring to arrive at that shore,
would offer an impenetrable, an impassable, barrier. Though not so to those
acquainted with the vicinity and used to threading the jungle, nor to the
Indians and half-castes whose huts and cabins bordered on that jungle, since
they knew every spot where passage might be made, and the coast thereby reached
at last.</p>

<p class="normal">Zara knew also each of those passages well, and threaded them
now with the confidence born of familiarity; with, too, the stern determination
to arrive at the end she had sworn to attain, if such attainment were possible.</p>

<p class="normal">She had left the room where Madame Carmaux had been
confronted, not only by her but by all the others, in the manner described; had
left it suddenly, though mysteriously, even as to her maddened brain a thought
had sprung, dispelling for the moment all the agony and passion with which that
brain was racked. The thought that, as she had sent the man she loved to his
doom, so, also, it might not yet be too late to avert that doom--to save him.</p>

<p class="normal">The Indians who were bearing him to the old ramshackle
sailing-boat he possessed (a thing half yawl and half lugger--a thing, too,
which she supposed those men had been instructed to pierce and bore so that it
would begin to fill from the first, and should, thereby, sink by the time it was
in deep water) must necessarily go slowly, owing to the burden they had to
carry, while she--well! she could progress almost as swiftly as the deer could
themselves thread the thickets that bordered the coast.</p>

<p class="normal">Surely, surely, lithe, young, and active as she was she would
overtake those men with their burden ere they could reach the yawl; she would be
able to bid them stop, and could at once point out to them the fatal mistake
that had been made. She could give them proof, by bidding them take one glance
at the features of the senseless man they were transporting, of the nature of
that mistake.</p>

<p class="normal">So she set out to overtake the Indians with their burden; set
out, staying for nothing, and allowing nothing to hinder her. For, swiftly as
she might go, every minute was still precious.</p>

<p class="normal">And now--now--as the night wind arose still more and the rusty
red of the lightning turned to a more purple-violet hue--sure warning of the
nearness of the coming storm--she was almost close to the beach where she knew
Sebastian's crazy old craft was kept in common with one or two others; namely, a
punt with a deep tank for fish, a scow, and a boat with oars. She was close to
the beach, but with, at this time, her heart like lead in her bosom because of
the fear she had that she was too late.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No sound,&quot; she muttered to herself. &quot;No voices to be heard.
They are gone. They are gone. I <i>am</i> too late!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Then, redoubling her exertions, she ran swiftly the remainder
of the distance to where she knew the boathouse--an erection of poles with
planks laid across them--stood.</p>

<p class="normal">And in a moment she knew that she was, indeed, too late. Where
the yawl usually floated there was now an empty space; there was nothing in the
boathouse but the punt and the rowboat.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Oh! what to do,&quot; she cried, &quot;what to do!&quot; and she beat her
breast as she so cried. &quot;They have carried him out to sea, even now the yawl is
sinking--has sunk--they will be on their way back. He is dead! he is dead! he
must be dead by now!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">While, overcome by the horror and misery of her thoughts, she
sank down to the ground. But not for long, however, since at such a crisis as
this her strong--if often ungovernable--heart became filled with greater courage
and resource. To sink to the ground, she told herself, to lie there wailing and
moaning over the impending fate of him she loved, was not the way to avert that
fate. Instead, she must be prompt and resolute.</p>

<p class="normal">She sprang, therefore, once more to her feet and--dark as was
all around her, except for the light of a young crescent moon peeping up over
the sea's rim and forcing a glimmer now and again through the banks of deep,
leaden clouds which the wind was bringing up from that sea--made her way into
the boathouse, where, swiftly unloosing the painter of the rowboat, she pushed
the latter out into the tumbling waves and began to scull it.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;They must have gone straight out,&quot; she thought, &quot;straight
out. And they would not go far. Only to where the water is deep enough for the
yawl to sink, or to encounter one of the many reefs--those jagged crested reefs
which would make a hole in her far worse than fifty awls could do.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Then still bending her supple frame over the oars, while her
little hands clenched them tightly, she rowed and rowed for dear life--as in
actual truth it was!--her breath coming faster and faster with her exertions,
her bosom heaving, but her courage indomitable.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I may not be too late,&quot; she whispered again and again; &quot;the
boat may not yet have filled. I may not be too late.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Suddenly she paused affrighted, startled; her heart seemed to
cease to beat, her hands were idle as they clutched the oars. Startled, and
despairing!</p>

<p class="normal">For out here the water was calmer, there being on it only the
long Atlantic roll that is so common beneath the roughness of the winds; except
for the slapping and crashing of those waves against the bows of the boat with
each rise and fall it made, there was scarcely any noise; certainly none such as
those waves had made, and would make against the boathouse and the long line of
the shore. So little noise that what she had heard before she heard again now,
as she sat listening and terrified in her place. She caught the beat of oars in
another boat, a boat that was drawing nearer to her with each fresh stroke--that
was, also, drawing nearer to the boathouse.</p>

<p class="normal">The Indians were returning. Their work was done!</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I am too late,&quot; she moaned. &quot;I am too late. God help us
both!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Then, too, she heard something else.</p>

<p class="normal">Over the waters, over the rolling waves, there came to her
ears the clear sounds of a man singing in a high tenor--it was almost a high
treble--a man singing a song in Maya which she, who was of their race, knew was
one that, in bygone days the Caribs and natives had sung in triumph over the
downfall of their enemies. A song which, when it was concluded, was followed by
a little bleating laugh, one which she knew well enough, a laugh which only one
man in all that neighbourhood could give. Then she heard words called out in a
half-chuckling, half-gloating tone, still in Maya.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Sink him beneath the sea forever,' she say, 'forever beneath
the sea.' And Paz he never for get, oh, never, never! Now he sunk,&quot; and again
she heard the bleating laugh, and again the beginning of that wild Carib song of
triumph.</p>

<p class="normal">Springing up, dropping the oars heedlessly--her heart almost
bursting--the girl rose from her seat, then shrieked aloud--sending her voice in
the direction where now there loomed before her eyes a blur beneath the moon's
glimmer which she knew to be a boat. &quot;Paz,&quot; she cried, &quot;Paz, it is not true, say
it is not true. Oh! Paz, where is he?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Where you wish. Where you tell me put him,&quot; the other called
back, while still beneath the brawny, muscular strokes of the Indians rowing it,
the boat swept on toward the shore. &quot;Beneath the waves or soon will be. Breaking
to pieces on Shark's Tooth Reef. Paz never forget.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Beast! devil!&quot; the girl cried in her agony, forgetting, or
recalling with redoubled horror, that what had been done was her own doing, was
perpetrated at her suggestion. &quot;Return and help me to save him. Oh! come back.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">But the boat was gone, was but a speck now beneath the moon,
and she was alone upon the sea, over which the wind howled as it lashed it to
fury at last.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;The Shark's Tooth Reef,&quot; she murmured. &quot;The Shark's Tooth
Reef, The worst of all around. Yet--yet--if caught on that, the yawl may not
sink. Oh! oh!&quot; and she muttered to herself some wild unexpressed words that were
doubtless a prayer. Then she grasped the oars once more, which, since they were
fixed by loops on to thole pins instead of being loose in rowlocks, had not
drifted away as might otherwise have been the case, and set the boat toward the
spot where the Shark's Tooth Reef was as nearly as she could guess.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;If I can but reach it,&quot; she muttered to herself. &quot;If I can
but reach it.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">But now her labours were more intense than before, her
struggles more terrible. For, coming straight toward the bow of the boat, the
Atlantic rollers beat it back with every stroke she took, while also they
deluged it with water, so that she knew ere long it must sink beneath the waves.
Already there were three or four inches in the bottom--nay, more, for the
stretchers were half-covered--another three of four and it would go down like
lead. And each fresh wave that broke over the bows added a further quantity.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;To see him once again; only to see him though if not to
save,&quot; she moaned--weeping at last; &quot;to see him, to be able to tell him that
though I sent him to his doom I loved him,&quot; while roused by the thought, she
still struggled on, buffeted and beaten by the waves; breathless, almost
lifeless--but still unconquered and unconquerable.</p>

<p class="normal">Suddenly she gave a gasp, a shriek. Close by her, rising up
some twenty feet from the sea, there was a cone-shaped rock, jagged and serrated
at its summit; black, too, and glistening as, in the rays of the fast rising
young moon, the water streaming from off it. It was the Shark's Tooth Reef, so
called because, from its long length of some fifty yards (a length also serrated
and jagged like the under jaw of a dog), there rose that cone-shaped thing which
resembled what it was named from.</p>

<p class="normal">And again she shrieked as, looking beyond the base of the
cone, peering through the hurtling waves and white filmy spume and spray, she
saw upon the further edge of the base of the reef a black, indistinct mass being
beaten to and fro. She heard, too, the grinding of that mass against the reef,
as well as its thumps as it was flung on and dragged off it by the swirling of
the sea; she heard, how each time, the force of the impact became louder and
more deadly.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;To reach him at last,&quot; she cried, &quot;to die with him! To die
together.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Then it seemed that into that quivering, nervous frame there
came a giant's strength; it seemed as though the cords and sinews of her arms
had become steel and iron, as though the little hands were vises in the power of
their grip. &quot;To die together,&quot; she thought again, as, with superhuman efforts,
she forced her boat toward the battered, broken yawl.</p>

<p class="normal">Now, she was close to it--now!--then, with a crash her own
boat was dashed against the larger one, its bow crushed in, in a moment, its
stem lifted into the air. But, catlike, desperate, too, fighting fate with the
determination of despair, she had seized the top of the yawl's side; had clung
to it one moment while the sea thundered and broke against her feet below, and
had then drawn herself up onto the deck over the side.</p>

<p class="normal">And he was there, lying half-in, half-out the little
forecastle cuddy, bound and corded--insensible.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I have found you, Sebastian,&quot; she whispered, her lips to his
cold ones. &quot;I have found you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">With an awful lurch the yawl heeled over, the man's body
rolling like a log as it did so, and then Zara knew that the end had come. Even
though he lived, nothing could save him now; his arms were bound tightly to his
sides, the cords passing over his chest from left to right. He was without sense
or power.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Nothing can save him now--nor me,&quot; she said. &quot;Nothing.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Then she forced her own little hands beneath those cords so
that, thereby, she was bound to him; whereby if ever they were found, they would
be found locked together; she grasping tightly, too, the top ply, so that
neither wave, nor roll of sea, nor any force could tear them apart again. And if
they were never found--still--still, nothing could part them more.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Together,&quot; she murmured, for the last time, her own strength
ebbing fast, &quot;together forever. Together at the end. Always together now--in
death!&quot;</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="div1_33" href="#div1Ref_33">CHAPTER XXXIII.</a></h4>

<h5>MADAME CARMAUX TELLS ALL</h5>
<br>

<p class="normal">Calmly--almost contemptuously--as though she
were in truth mistress of Desolada and a woman who conferred honour upon those
who followed her, instead of one who was in actual fact their prisoner, Madame
Carmaux led the way to that parlour wherein she had promised to divulge all; to
reveal the secret of how another man had usurped for so long the place and
position which rightfully belonged to Julian Ritherdon.</p>

<p class="normal">And they who followed her, observing how rigid, how masklike
were the handsome features; how the soft, dark eyes gleamed now with a hard,
determined look, knew that as she had said, so she would do; so she would
perform. They recognised that she would not falter in her task, she deeming that
what she divulged would tell in Sebastian's favour.</p>

<p class="normal">Still firm and calm, therefore, and still as though she were
the owner of that house which she had ruled for so long with absolute sway, she
motioned to Julian and Mr. Spranger to be seated--while standing before them
enveloped in the long loose robe of soft black material in which she had been
clad, and with the lace hood thrown back from her head and setting free the dark
masses of hair which had always been one of her greatest beauties--hair in which
there was scarcely, even now, a streak of white.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is,&quot; she murmured, when the lights had been brought, &quot;for
Sebastian's sake, if he still lives. And to prove to you that he is
innocent--was innocent until almost the day when he, that other, came here,&quot; and
her glance fell on Julian--&quot;that I tell you all which I am about to do. Also,
that I tell you how I alone am the guilty one.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Her eyes resting on those of Julian and Mr. Spranger, they
both signified by a look that they were prepared to hear all she might have to
narrate. Then, ere she began the recital she was about to make, she said:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yet, if you desire more witnesses, call them in. Let them
hear, too. I care neither for what they may think of me, nor what testimony they
may bear against me in the future. Call in whom you will.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">For a moment the two men before her looked into each other's
faces; then Mr. Spranger said:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Perhaps it would be as well to have another witness,
especially as Mr. Ritherdon is the most interested person. My daughter is
outside, if--if your story contains nothing she may not hear----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It contains nothing,&quot; Madame Carmaux answered, there being a
tone of contempt in it which she did not endeavour to veil, &quot;but the story of a
crime, a fraud, worked out by a deserted, heartbroken woman. Call her in.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Then, summoned by Julian, Beatrix entered the room, and,
taking a seat between her father and her lover, was an ear-witness to all that
the other woman had to tell.</p>

<p class="normal">For a moment it seemed as if Madame Carmaux scarce knew how to
commence; for a few moments she stood before them, her eyes sometimes cast down
upon the floor, sometimes seeking theirs. Then, suddenly, she said:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;That narrative which George Ritherdon wrote in England when
he was dying, and sent to his brother Charles, who was himself close to his end,
was true.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It was true!&quot; whispered Julian, repeating her words, &quot;I knew
it was! I was sure of it! Yet how--how--was the deception accomplished?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He loved me,&quot; madame exclaimed, she hardly, as it seemed,
hearing or heeding Julian's remark. &quot;Charles loved me--till he saw her, Isobel
Leigh. And I--I--well, I had never loved any other man. I did not know what love
was till I saw him. Then--then--he--what need to seek for easy words--he jilted
me, and, in despair, I married Carmaux on the day that he married her. It seemed
to my distracted heart that by doing so I might more effectually erase his
memory from my mind forever. And my son was born but a week or so before you,
Julian Ritherdon, were born.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Sebastian. Not a daughter?&quot; Julian said.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes; Sebastian; not a daughter. Yet, later, when it was
necessary that my child should be registered, I recorded the birth as that of a
daughter, and at the same time I registered that daughter's death. Later, you
will understand why it was necessary that any child of mine should disappear out
of existence, and also why, above all things, it must never be known that I had
a son.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Again Julian looked in Mr. Spranger's eyes, and Mr. Spranger
into his, their glances telling each other plainly that, even now, they thought
they began to understand.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I heard,&quot; Madame Carmaux went on, &quot;that she too had borne a
son, and in some strange, heartbroken excitement that took possession of me, I
determined to go and see Charles Ritherdon, to show him my child, to prove to
him--as I thought it would do--that if he who had forgotten me was happy in
marriage, so, too, was I. Happy! oh, my God! However, no matter for my
happiness--I went.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I arrived here late at night, and I found him almost
distracted. His wife was dying: she could not live, they said; how was the child
to live without her? Then I promised that, if he would let me stay on at
Desolada, I would be as much a mother to that child as to my own, that I would
forget his cruelty to me, that I would forgive.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Come,' he said to me, on hearing this, 'come and see
them--come.' And I went with him to the room where she was, where you were,&quot; and
she looked at Julian.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I went to that room,&quot; she continued, &quot;with every honest
feeling in my heart that a woman who had sworn to condone a man's past
faithlessness could have; before Heaven I swear that I went to that room
resolved to be what I had said, a second mother to you. I went with pity in my
heart for the poor dying woman--the woman who had never really loved her
husband, but, instead, had loved his brother. For, as you know well enough, she
had been forced to jilt George Ritherdon even as Charles had jilted me. I went
to that room and then--then we learned that she was dead. But, also, we learned
something else. There was no child by her side. It was gone. Its place was
empty.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I begin to understand,&quot; murmured Julian, while Beatrix and
her father showed by their expression that to them also a glimmering of light
was coming.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yet,&quot; said Madame Carmaux, &quot;scarcely can you
understand--scarcely dream of--the temptation that fell in my way. In a moment,
at the instant that Charles Ritherdon saw that his child was missing, he cried,
'This is my brothers doing! It is he who has stolen it. To murder it, to be
avenged on me for having won his future wife from him. I know it.' And,
distractedly, he raved again and again that it was his brother's doing. In vain
I tried to pacify him, saying that his brother was far away in the States. To my
astonishment he told me that, on the contrary, he was here, close at hand, if
not even now lurking in the plantation of Desolada, or at Belize.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'I saw him there yesterday,' he cried, 'I saw him with my own
eyes. Now I understand what took him there. It was to steal my child--to murder
it. Great God! to thereby become my heir.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;As he spoke there came a footfall in the passage; some one
was coming. Perhaps the nurse returning; perhaps, also, if George Ritherdon had
only been there a short time before us, she did not know that the child had been
kidnapped. 'And if she does not know, then no one else can know,' he cried.
'While,' he said, 'if that unutterable villain, George, thinks to profit by this
theft, I will thwart him. He may rob me of my child, he may murder the poor
innocent babe--but he at least shall never be my heir,' and as he spoke his eyes
fell on
<i>my</i> child in my arms. 'Cover it up,' he whispered, 'show its face only,
otherwise the clothes it wears will betray it. Cover it up.'&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;If this is true, the crime was his,&quot; whispered Julian.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;<i>That</i> crime was his,&quot; said Madame Carmaux, &quot;the rest
was mine. But--let me continue. As Charles spoke, the nurse was at the door--a
negro woman who died six months afterward--a moment later she was in the room.
Yet not before I had had time to whisper a word in his ear, to say, 'If I do
this, it is forever? If your child is never found, is mine to remain in its
place?'--and with a glance he seemed to answer, 'Yes.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;None ever knew of that substitution, no living soul ever knew
that the child growing up as his, its birth registered by him at Belize as his,
was, in truth, mine. Not one living soul. Nor were you ever heard of again. We
agreed to believe that you had been made away with. Yet, as time went on,
Charles Ritherdon seemed to repent of what he had done; he came to think that,
after all, his brother might not have been the thief, or, being so, that he had
not slain the child; to also think that perhaps some of the half-castes or
Indians, on whom he was occasionally hard, might have stolen it out of revenge.
And it required all my tears and supplications, all my prayers to him to
remember that, had he not been cruelly false to me, it would in truth have been
our child which was the rightful heir, which was here--his child and mine! At
last he consented--provided that the other--the real child--you--were never
heard of again. My son should remain in his son's place, if you never appeared
to claim that place.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Sebastian grew up in utter ignorance of all; he grew up also
to resemble strangely the man who was supposed to be his father--perhaps because
from the moment I married Monsieur Carmaux it was not his image but that of
Charles Ritherdon which was ever in my mind.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;But when George Ritherdon's statement came, and with it the
information that you were in existence, Charles determined to tell Sebastian
everything. He would have done so, too, but that the illness he was suffering
from took a fatal termination almost directly afterward--doubtless from the
shock of learning what he did. Yet it made no difference, for the day after his
death Sebastian found the paper and so discovered all.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He knew then,&quot; said Julian--though as he spoke his voice was
not harsh, he recognising how cruel had been this woman's lot from the first,
and how doubly cruel must have been the blow which fell on her when, after
twenty-five years of possession, the son whom she had loved so, and had schemed
so for, was about to be dispossessed--&quot;he knew then who I was when we first met,
and--and--God forgive him!--from that moment commenced to plot my death.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No!&quot; cried Madame Carmaux. &quot;No! Have I not said that he was
innocent? It was I--I--who plotted--alas! he was my son. Will not a mother do
all for her only child? It was I who changed the horses in their stalls, putting
his, which none but he could ride in safety, in place of the sure-footed one he
had destined for you; it was I--God help and pardon me! who put the coral snake
in your bed--I--I--who did the rest you know of.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And did you, too, procure the Indians who were to take me out
to sea and drown me?&quot; asked Julian with a doubtful glance at her. &quot;Surely not.
There was a man's hand in that. And it was Sebastian who was advancing along the
passage when Zara's knife struck him down.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;By instigation I did it,&quot; Madame Carmaux cried, determined to
the last to shield the son she still hoped to meet again in this world--&quot;the
suggestion, the plot was mine alone. While because he was weak, because from the
first he has ever yielded to me, he yielded now. Spare him!&quot; she cried, and
flung herself upon her knees before that listening trio, her calmness, her
contemptuousness, vanished now. &quot;Spare him, and do with me what you will.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">So the story was told, so the discovery of all was made at
last. Julian knew now upon how simple a thing--the fact of Madame Carmaux having
taken that strange determination to go and see the man who had cast her off and
jilted her, carrying her child in her arms--the whole mystery had rested. But
what he never knew was that, had Zara lived, she could have also told him all.
For in the savage girl's love for the man, who in his turn had treated her
badly, and in her determination to be ever watching over him, she had long since
overheard scraps of conversation which had revealed the secret to her in the
same way as they had done to Paz.</p>

<p class="normal">And it was to her, and her determination to prevent Sebastian
from committing any crime by which his life or his liberty might become
imperilled, that Julian owed the fact that he had not long since died by the
hand of Madame Carmaux--if not by that of Sebastian.</p>

<h5>CONTENTMENT</h5>
<br>

<p style="margin-left:15%; text-indent:-10px">&quot;And on her lover's arm she leaned,<br>
And 'round her waist she felt it fold.&quot;</p>

<br>
<p class="normal">Some two or three months of Julian's leave remained to expire
at the time when the foregoing explanation had taken place, and perhaps nothing
which had occurred since the day when he first set foot in British Honduras had
caused him more perplexity than his present deliberations as to how to make the
best of that period.</p>

<p class="normal">For now he knew that he had done with the colony for ever; he
had achieved that for which he had come to it; he had proved the truth of George
Ritherdon's statement up to the hilt, and--in so far as obtaining the possession
of that which was undoubtedly his--well! the law would soon take steps to enable
him to do so.</p>

<p class="normal">Only, when he told himself that he had done with the colony,
when he reflected that henceforth his foot would never tread on its earth more,
he had also to tell himself that he could alone consent to sever his connection
with it by also taking away with him the most precious thing it contained in his
eyes--Beatrix Spranger.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;For,&quot; he said to that young lady, as once more they sat in
the garden at &quot;Floresta,&quot; with about and around them all the surroundings that
he had learned to know so well and to recall during many of the gloomy nights
and days he had spent at Desolada--the great shade palms, the gorgeous
flamboyants and delicate oleander blossoms, as well as the despairing looking
and lugubrious monkey--&quot;for, darling, I cannot go without you. If I were to do
so, Heaven alone knows when I could return to claim you; and, also, I cannot
wait. Sweetheart, you too must sail for England with me, and it must be as Mrs.
Ritherdon.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He said the same thing often. Indeed at night, which is--as
those acquainted with such matters tell us--the period when young ladies pass in
review the principal events that have happened to them during the day, Beatrix
used to consider, or rather to calculate, that he made the same remark about
twenty times daily. While, since, loving and gentle as she was, she was also
possessed of a considerable amount of feminine perspicacity, she supposed that
he reiterated the phrase upon the principle that the constant drop of water
which falls upon a stone will at last wear it away.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Though,&quot; the girl would say to herself in those soft hours of
maiden meditation, &quot;he need not fear. He cannot but think that his longing is
also shared by me.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Aloud, however, when once more he repeated what had become
almost a set phrase, she said:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You know that you have taken an unfair advantage of me.
Indeed, though it was only by chance, you have put me to terrible mortification.
You overheard my avowal to that unhappy girl, my avowal that--that--I loved
you.&quot; And Beatrix blushed most beautifully as she softly uttered the words.
&quot;Think what an avowal it was. To be made by a woman for a man who had never
asked for her love.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Had he not,&quot; Julian said, &quot;had he not, Beatrix? Never asked
for that love on one happy day spent alone by that woman's side, when he
confided everything to her that bore upon his presence here; and she, full of
soft and gentle sympathy, told him all her fears and anxiety for the risks he
might run. And, did he not ask for that love on the night which followed that
day, as they rode back to Belize beneath the stars?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">And now his eyes were gazing into hers with a look of love
which no woman could doubt, even though no other man had ever looked at her so
before; while since loverlike, they were sitting close together, his arm stole
round her waist.</p>

<p class="normal">To the inexperienced--the present narrator included--it may be
permitted to wonder how lovers learn to do these things as well as how they
discover, too, the efficacy of such subtle tenderness; yet one is told that they
are done, and that the success thereof is indisputable.</p>

<p class="normal">Nor, with Beatrix, did either the look of love or the soft
environment of his arm fail in their effort, as may be judged from her answer to
his whispered question, &quot;It shall be, shall it not, darling?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes,&quot; she murmured, blushing again and more deeply. &quot;Yes. If
father permits.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">And so Julian's love grew toward a triumphant termination; yet
still there were other matters to be seen to and arranged ere he, with his wife
by his side, should quit the colony forever. One thing, however, it transpired,
would require little trouble in arranging; namely, the property of Desolada,
when the law should put him in possession of it, since, on investigation being
made after the disappearance of Sebastian, it was found to be so heavily
mortgaged that to pay off the loans upon it would leave Julian without any
capital whatever; while, at the same time, he would be saddled with a possession
in a country with which he had nothing in common. Of what had become of the
money left by Charles Ritherdon at his death (and it had been a substantial sum)
or of what had become of the other sums borrowed on Desolada, there was no one
to inform them.</p>

<p class="normal">Sebastian had disappeared, was undoubtedly gone forever--and
of his fate there could be little doubt. Certainly there could be no doubt in
the minds of either Beatrix or Julian or of Mr. Spranger, who had of course been
made acquainted with the substitution of Sebastian for Julian. Zara also had
disappeared, and Madame Carmaux had--escaped.</p>

<p class="normal">How she had done it no one ever knew, but in the morning which
followed that eventful night when she made her confession, she was missing from
her room, at the door of which one of the constabulary had been set as a guard.
That she should be able so to evade those who were passing the night at Desolada
was easily to be comprehended when, the next day, her room was examined; they
understood how she might have passed on to the balcony outside that room, have
traversed it for some distance, and then have made her way into some other
apartment, and so from that have descended the great stairs in the darkness, and
stolen away into the plantations. At any rate, whether these surmises were
correct or not, she was gone, and she has never since been seen in British
Honduras.</p>

<p class="normal">Yet one planter, who makes frequent journeys to New Orleans in
connection with his imports and exports, declares that only a few months ago he
saw her in Lafayette Square in that city. It was at the time when the terrible
scourge of Louisiana, the yellow fever, is most dreaded, and even as the planter
entered the Square he saw a man lying prostrate on the ground, while afar off
from him, because of fear of the infection, yet regarding him with a gaping
curiosity, was a crowd of negroes and whites. Then, still watching the scene,
this gentleman saw a woman clad in the garb of a Nun of Calvary, who approached
the prostrate man, and, while calling on those near to assist him, ministered to
his wants in so far as she could. And, her veil falling aside, the planter
declared that he saw plainly the face of the woman who, in British Honduras, had
been known for a quarter of a century as Miriam Carmaux. He also recognized her
voice.</p>

<p class="normal">If such were the case, if, at last, that tempestuous soul--the
soul of a woman who, in her earlier days, had had meted out to her a more cruel
fate than falls to the lot of most women--if at last the erring woman who had
been driven to fraud and crime by the love she bore her child--had found calm,
if not peace, beneath that holy garb, perhaps those who have heard her story may
be disposed to think of her without harshness. Such was the case with Julian
Ritherdon, who, as she made her confession, forgave her for all that she had
attempted against him--since she was scarcely a greater sinner than his own
father, who had countenanced the fraud she perpetrated, or his uncle, whose
early vindictiveness led to that fraud. Such, also, was the case with Beatrix,
from whose gentle eyes fell tears as she listened to the narrative told by the
unhappy woman while she was yet uncertain of the doom of the son for whom she
had so long schemed and plotted. And so let it be with others. If she had erred,
so also she had suffered. And, by suffering, is atonement made.</p>
<br>

<p class="normal">You could not have witnessed, perhaps, a brighter scene than that which took
place on a clear October morning in the handsome Gothic church of Belize, when
Julian Ritherdon and Beatrix Spranger became man and wife.</p>

<p class="normal">Space has not permitted for the introduction of the reader to
several other sweet young English maidens whose parents' affairs have led to
their residences in the colony; yet such maidens there are in Honduras--as the
inquiring traveller may see for himself, if he chooses--and of these fair exiles
some were, this morning, bridesmaids. They, you may be sure, lent brightness and
brilliancy to the scene, and so did the uniforms of several young officers of
her Majesty's navy, these gentlemen having been impressed into the ceremony For,
as luck would have it, not a week before, H.M.S. Cerberus (twin-screw cruiser,
first-class, armoured) had anchored, off Belize, and, as those acquainted with
the Royal navy are aware, no officer of that noble service can come into contact
with any ship belonging to it (as Julian Ritherdon soon did) without finding
therein old friends and comrades. Be very sure also, therefore, that George
Hope, George Potter, John Hamilton, that most illustrious of naval doctors,
&quot;Jock&quot; Lyons, and many others dear to friends both in and out of the service,
all came ashore in the bravery of their full dress--epaulettes, cocked hats, and
so forth--while the <i>Padré</i> &quot;stood by&quot; to lend a hand to the local
clergyman in performing the ceremony. While, too, the path from the churchyard
gates to the church door was lined by bluejackets who, of course, were here clad
in their &quot;whites&quot; and straw hats.</p>

<p class="normal">But, because rumour ever runneth swift of foot, even in so
small a colony as this--where, naturally, its feet have not so much ground to
cover--and in so small a capital as Belize, with its six thousand inhabitants,
the church was also filled with many others drawn from the various races, mixed
and pure, who dwell therein. For, by now, there was scarcely a person in either
the colony or capital to whose ears there had not come the news that the
handsome young officer who was in a few moments to become the husband of Miss
Spranger, was, in truth, the rightful owner of Desolada. Likewise, all knew that
Sebastian had never been that owner, but that he was the son of Carmaux, who had
perished by the fangs of the tommy-goff, and of the dark, mysterious beauty who
had come among them as Miriam Gardelle and had married him. And they knew, too,
that this marriage was to be the reward and crown of dangers run by Julian, of
more than one attempt upon his life, as well as that it was the outcome of a
deep fraud perpetrated and kept dark for many years.</p>

<p class="normal">Paz was there, too, his eyes glistening with rapture at the
sound of the Wedding March, his weird soul being ever stirred by music; so,
also, was Monsieur Lemaire, grave, dignified, and calm as became a French
gentleman in exile, and with, about him as ever, that flavour of one who ought
by right to have walked in the gardens of Versailles two hundred years ago, and
have basked in the smiles of the Great Monarch.</p>

<p class="normal">And so they were married, nor can it be doubted that they will
live happy ever afterward--to use the sweet, old-time expression of the
storybooks of our infancy. Married--she given away by her father; he supported
by his oldest friend in the Cerberus--and both passing happy! Married, and going
forth along the path of life, he most probably to distinction in his calling,
she to the duties of an honest English wife. Married and happy. What more was
needed?</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I come,&quot; he said to her that afternoon, when already the
steamer was leaving Honduras far astern, and they were travelling by the new
route toward Kingstown on their road to England--&quot;I came to Honduras to find
perhaps a father, perhaps an inheritance. Neither was to be granted to me, but,
instead, something five thousand times more precious--a wife five thousand times
more dear than any parent or any possession.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And,&quot; she asked, her pure, earnest eyes gazing into his, &quot;you
are contented? You are sure that that will make you happy?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">To which he replied--as--well! as, perhaps--if a man--you
would have replied yourself.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
